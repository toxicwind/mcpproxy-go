# macOS post-install: quit the old instance, then launch the newly installed one.
#
# Spec 044 (T057) — launch the tray tagged as "installer-launched".
# Spec 092 (FR-004, issue #957) — quit whatever is already running FIRST.
#
# Invoked by the DMG "Install" step (when the DMG wraps an installer .pkg) or
# by a future productbuild-based installer.
#
# Why the quit step exists. `open -a` ACTIVATES a running instance rather than
# starting a new one, so an installer that only calls `open -a` brings the OLD,
# just-overwritten app to the foreground: the user watches an upgrade complete
# and is handed the previous version, still serving from the previous core.
# That is the reported bug. Quitting first is what makes the launch below a
# launch.
#
# Politeness ladder — `osascript … to quit`, then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL — so a
# graceful exit is always tried first. The app installs signal handlers that
# route SIGTERM through its normal quit path (AppLifecycle.installSignalHandlers),
# so even the fallback stops the managed core rather than orphaning it. Should
# a core survive anyway (one the user started themselves), the new tray's
# stale-core supersede (Spec 092 FR-001/FR-002) picks it up.
#
# The `--env MCPPROXY_LAUNCHED_BY=installer` flag is honored by macOS's `open`
# command and inherited by the tray and core child processes. The core
# consumes the env var in Runtime.SetTelemetry (cmd wire-up) and stores a
# one-shot installer_heartbeat_pending=true flag in the activation BBolt
# bucket. The flag is cleared after the very first heartbeat is built —
# subsequent heartbeats report launch_source=login_item or =tray.
#
# **Critical**: we launch via `launchctl asuser <uid> ... env -i ...` so the
# tray app starts in the user's GUI bootstrap context with a clean env. A
# bare `open -a` invoked from postinstall propagates the PKInstallSandbox
# environment (PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/libexec, SHELL=/bin/sh,
# INSTALLER_*) into the launched app and every child it spawns — that broke
# Docker discovery in the long-running mcpproxy core (sync.Once permanently
# cached the failed lookup). The clean-env launch mirrors what users get when
# they double-click the app from Finder.
#
# This script is idempotent: re-running it quits and relaunches the app.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — launched
#   1 — MCPProxy.app not found in /Applications (installer bug)
