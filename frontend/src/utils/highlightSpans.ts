// Turning scan spans into renderable segments of a tool description.
//
// The contract with the backend (`detect.Span`, internal/security/detect/span.go):
// `start`/`end` are half-open UTF-16 code-unit offsets into the tool's RAW
// description, so `text.slice(start, end)` is exactly the matched words. Nothing
// here searches the text — a stale span degrades to plain text rather than
// guessing, because a six-character token appearing four times in a 4,500-char
// description makes "find it again" a coin flip that confidently marks innocuous
// prose. Verify, or degrade honestly. There is deliberately NO indexOf fallback.
//
// The segmentation is a BOUNDARY SWEEP, not interval nesting: every span
// start/end goes into one sorted, de-duplicated boundary set and one segment is
// emitted per interval, carrying every span that covers it. Two overlapping
// spans therefore become ONE segment with two sources — never nested <mark>
// elements, never duplicated or dropped characters. The invariant
//
//     segments.map(s => s.text).join('') === text
//
// holds for every input and is asserted by tests/unit/highlight-spans.spec.ts.
