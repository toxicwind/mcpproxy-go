 * affordances: Escape does not close, focus stays on the trigger button and

 * supplies those three behaviours plus focus restoration, without changing how
 * the dialogs are mounted or styled.

 * Usage:
 *   const { dialogRef } = useModalA11y(() => props.show, handleClose)
 *   <div class="modal-box" ref="dialogRef" role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
