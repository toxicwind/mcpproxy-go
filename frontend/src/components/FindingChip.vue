/**
 * Compact per-tool scan status, following the HoldEvidenceBadge house pattern
 * (badge + tone + glyph + explanatory title).
 *
 * Two invariants govern the tones, and they are the whole reason this is a
 * component rather than an inline ternary:
 *
 *   * an unscanned tool is never styled as a safe tool — it renders nothing;
 *   * a FAILED scan is never styled as a threat. A scan that could not finish is
 *     a coverage precaution, not a verdict, so it takes the same neutral tone
 *     `holdEvidence.reasonPresentation()` gives HOLD_REASON_SCAN_COVERAGE and
 *     must never render red.
 *
 * Declared in a plain <script> block so other modules can import the union;
 * <script setup> is not an export surface.
