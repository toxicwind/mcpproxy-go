// TestActivityFilter_AgentTokenIsNotItsOwnersSession is the sweep finding from

//
// GetUserActivity gated on `ac.UserID != ""`. Before issue #1168 an agent token
// carried no UserID, so that check refused it; afterwards the field is its
// OWNER's id, and the same check would hand a scoped, read-only agent token its
// owner's entire activity log. The gate belongs on the user TIER — the rule this
// branch already applied in getUserID and never propagated here.
//
// Oracle discipline: this does NOT assert "the response omits the records" (an
// empty result is what a working filter and a broken fixture both produce).
// It asserts the request is REFUSED, and pairs that with a positive control on
// the same filter and the same fixture proving the owner's session DOES see the
// records — so an empty agent result cannot be an empty store.

// BITES: without the IsUser() gate the agent context returns the owner's record.
