// SchemaVersion is the heartbeat payload schema version. v1 payloads have no
// such field; receivers can route by absence vs presence.
//
// v3 (schema bump from 2): adds feature_flags.docker_available,
// server_protocol_counts, and server_docker_isolated_count.
//
// v4 (schema bump from 3): adds onboarding-funnel fields per Spec 046 —
// connected_client_count, connected_client_ids, wizard_engaged,
// wizard_connect_step, wizard_server_step. Forward-compatible: existing
// v3 consumers ignore the new fields.
//
// v5 (schema bump from 4): adds docker-isolation visibility per MCP-2745 —
// feature_flags.docker_isolation_enabled, feature_flags.docker_cli_source
// (4-way enum: path|bundled|login_shell|absent, the #696 fleet signal), and
// three new diagnostics codes surfaced via error_code_counts_24h
// (MCPX_DOCKER_CLI_NOT_FOUND / MCPX_DOCKER_EXEC_NOT_FOUND /
// MCPX_DOCKER_OCI_RUNTIME). Additive only — v3/v4 consumers ignore them.
//
// v6 (schema bump from 5): adds machine_id — a stable, non-reversible hash of
// the OS machine id (HMAC-SHA256 keyed by the OS machine id, scoped by an
// app-specific key). It lets the dashboard dedup installs whose anonymous_id
// churns every run (ephemeral Docker layers, throwaway HOMEs, CI). Additive
// and forward-compatible: v3/v4/v5 consumers ignore it, and the ingest worker
// stores payload_json wholesale without rejecting unknown fields or higher
// schema versions.
//
// v7 (schema bump from 6): Spec 080 — honest activation funnel + churn
// instrumentation. Additive only; v6-and-earlier consumers ignore every
// addition:
//   - wizard_connect_step enum widened with "completed_external" (connected
//     outside the wizard — CLI/ConnectModal/manual config — detected at
//     dismissal). Consumers switching on completed|skipped must treat
//     unknown values as "other/engaged".
//   - wizard_shown (bool): wizard rendered at least once, making "shown but
//     ignored" observable alongside wizard_engaged.
//   - web_ui_opened (int64): lifetime count of embedded Web UI index-document
//     serves, independent of surface_requests.webui.
//   - days_since_install (*int): whole-day UTC install age from a persisted
//     first-install day stamp; 0 is transmitted, nil (store not wired) omits.
//   - active_days_30d (int): count of distinct active UTC days in the
//     trailing 30-day window; the per-day set never leaves the machine.
//   - previous_shutdown (enum "clean"|"crash", absent = unknown/first run):
//     how the PREVIOUS process instance ended, from a persisted marker.
//   - last_error_code (enum MCPX_*): most recent stable diagnostic code,
//     persisted across restarts; never message text, names, or paths.
//
// All v7 fields are omitempty (zero-valued payloads stay shape-compatible
// with v6), fixed-enum/boolean/non-negative-integer only (enforced by
// ScanForPII), and ride the existing opt-out gate.
//
// v8 (schema bump from 7): anonymous TPA / security-scanner stats. Additive
// only; v7-and-earlier consumers ignore both additions:
//   - tpa_scanner (object, omitted entirely when every counter is zero — the
//     same posture as diagnostics): scans_completed, scans_failed,
//     scans_with_findings (non-negative integer counts over the reporting
//     window, reset only after an accepted heartbeat) and findings, a sparse
//     map from the FIXED severity enum (critical|high|medium|low|info) to a
//     non-negative count.
//   - feature_flags.deep_scan_enabled (bool): the opt-in deep-scan master
//     switch (security.deep_scan.enabled), so scan volume can be read against
//     the population that actually enabled the layer.
//
// The unit of every tpa_scanner counter is ONE NON-DEEP-SCAN (PASS 1) SCAN JOB:
// the Pass-2 deep supply-chain audit that deep scan auto-starts after Pass 1 is
// NOT counted (counting it would double the apparent scan volume of exactly the
// deep-scan cohort deep_scan_enabled exists to compare), dry-run jobs are NOT
// counted, and a job with several failing scanners is still one scan —
// scans_failed counts failed jobs, not failed scanners. The producer is
// scanCallbackAdapter.countsForTelemetry in internal/security/scanner.
//
// Anonymity properties: counts and fixed enum keys ONLY. Scanned server
// names, scanner ids, rule ids, finding titles, file paths, and error
// messages are never accepted by the counter API, and ScanForPII re-asserts
// the shape on the wire form (rule "v8_field_invalid"): tpa_scanner must be
// an object whose keys are whitelisted, whose scalar values are non-negative
// integers, and whose findings keys are members of the severity enum.
// Schema v9 makes the TPA funnel measurable. Two additions:
//
//   - tpa_scanner.tool_change_gate_scans / tpa_scanner.prompt_scans: delta
//     counters for the two SYNCHRONOUS detection paths that run for ordinary
//     users — the trust_mode:scan tool-change gate
//     (internal/runtime.scanChangeIsClean) and the aggregated-prompt poisoning
//     filter (internal/server.scanAggregatedPrompts). Neither emitted anything
//     before v9, so the v8 job counters alone made the fleet look like it never
//     scanned. Same window and reset semantics as every other registry counter
//     (zeroed only after an accepted send), and the whole tpa_scanner
//     sub-object is still omitted when every counter — v8 and v9 — is zero.
//   - trust_mode_distribution: a STATE field (not a delta), the count of
//     configured servers per config.ServerConfig.EffectiveTrustMode(), keyed by
//     the fixed auto|scan|manual enum and computed fresh at heartbeat build
//     time. It is the denominator the gate counter needs: gate scans are only
//     possible on servers in "scan" mode.
//
// Anonymity posture is unchanged: non-negative integer counts and fixed enum
// keys only. ScanForPII re-asserts both shapes on the wire form (rules
// "v8_field_invalid" for the widened tpa_scanner whitelist and
// "trust_mode_field_invalid" for the histogram).
//
// v11 (MCP-2967) adds diagnostics.current_error_codes and, more importantly,
// changes the MEANING of diagnostics.error_code_counts_24h: it is now
// edge-triggered (one count per new failure or new failed attempt) where v10
// and earlier re-counted every standing failure on the supervisor's 30s
// reconcile ticker. v10-and-earlier error-code volumes are therefore NOT
// comparable with v11 ones and must not be graphed on a single series —
// v10 counted roughly failing-servers x uptime/30s, not user-visible events.
// current_error_codes carries the standing-state signal that edge-triggering
// would otherwise have removed. Anonymity posture unchanged: fixed MCPX_ enum
// keys, non-negative integer counts.
//
// v12 adds heartbeat_id, a random UUID that identifies one reset-on-accept
// counter window. It stays stable across retries and rotates only after the
// sender observes a 2xx response. Receivers can therefore INSERT counter
// events idempotently even when a response is lost after the endpoint has
// committed the heartbeat. The id is random, contains no machine data, and is
// scoped to one reporting window.
//
// v13 (Spec 107): feature_flags.server_edition_enabled (bool), feature_flags.idp_provider
// (closed enum google|github|microsoft|oidc|none — never an issuer), member_count_bucket
// (closed enum 0|1-10|11-100|101-1000|1000+; "0" when no user counter is installed — the personal
// edition — and omitted only when the installed counter errors).
// env_markers.is_container unchanged. No worker migration: fields ride in payload_json.
//
// The wire key is member_count_bucket, not the user_count_bucket the Spec 107
// contract first named: ScanForPII rule 2 substring-matches the home-dir
// basename against the WHOLE wire form, keys included, and "user" is the
// username of every `USER user` container image (the server edition's own
// topology). A key containing "user" would have had every heartbeat from such
// an install refused before it left the machine. See
// TestPayloadV13_PassesScanWithCommonUsernameBlocked.
