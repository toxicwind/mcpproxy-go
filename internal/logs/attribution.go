// Spec 105 FR-007 (research D8): per-record log ownership.
//
// Two raw server names can share ONE per-server log file — `a/b` and `a_b`
// both sanitise to server-a_b.log (sanitizeServerLogName), and on a
// case-insensitive filesystem so do `A` and `a` — so a scoped caller tailing
// "its" server must receive only the records its server actually wrote. There
// is NO new field for that (D8): every per-server writer already stamps each
// record with `server=<raw name>` (NewUpstreamServerLogger), so administrator
// records and the whole-file reader (ReadUpstreamServerLogTail) are
// byte-identical to before. Unforgeability comes from two rules:
//
//  1. Producer rule: child-controlled text (stderr lines, launcher-pumped
//     stdout/stderr, docker CLI output) is only ever a zap FIELD VALUE, where
//     the encoder escapes it inside the fields object, on a record stamped
//     child_output=true (ChildOutputField). internal/upstream/core audits
//     every per-server log call site for a constant message. Files written
//     by builds before codex round 2 carry the launcher-pumped child line as
//     the MESSAGE; rule 2 judges that shape and withholds it when the child
//     text carries a boundary or a record header.
//  2. Reader rule: a console-encoder record is
//     `ts | LEVEL | caller | msg | {fields}` (`caller` is absent on the
//     OAuth tee, which has no AddCaller). The reader takes the FIRST ` | {`
//     boundary on the line and accepts the record only if (a) the text in
//     front of the boundary starts with exactly ONE record header
//     (`ts | LEVEL | `, consoleHeaderPattern) and contains no second one,
//     and (b) the boundary's suffix decodes as exactly one complete JSON
//     object with no trailing bytes that is not itself a JSON-encoder record.
//     Child text inside a field value is escaped and cannot close the object
//     early or start a boundary. The reader never scans past a failed
//     boundary, and (a) is what makes a torn record harmless: a torn record
//     with no terminator (partial final write) followed by an appended
//     complete record shares one physical line, and the later record's
//     boundary would otherwise attribute the whole line — foreign fragment
//     included — to the later writer (codex round 1). A tear inside the
//     fragment's header leaves no header at offset 0; a tear anywhere after
//     it leaves the fragment's header in front of the later record's — two
//     headers (codex round 2). A fragment torn right after its caller
//     separator in front of a JSON-encoder record leaves one header and a
//     suffix that decodes: that suffix carries the JSON encoder's own
//     `level`/`ts`/`msg` keys, which a console fields object never does, so
//     (b) rejects it. A line that starts with `{` is a JSON-encoder record
//     (or a torn one) and is judged as that single object, never by the
//     console scan. Lines with no accepted boundary (pre-stamp records, torn
//     fragments, launcher-era child lines carrying ` | {` as the message)
//     are non-attributable and withheld from scoped callers.
//  3. Subject-evidence rule (historical records): a stamp proves who WROTE a
//     record, not that every subject it names is that server's. A record
//     that names a container is attributable only when it carries
//     `container_owner` (the container's com.mcpproxy.server label, written
//     by the housekeeping paths since Spec 105) equal to the requested
//     server; the sanitised container name is never evidence (`a/b` and
//     `a-b` both name mcpproxy-a-b-*). A record whose `server` field names
//     another server (a pre-105 callback-stop record routed through the
//     wrong logger) is withheld. Child output is a container subject too
//     when it mentions one: Docker's own `docker run` failure names the
//     colliding container's id and name (`a/b` and `a-b` both generate
//     mcpproxy-a-b-*), and that text reaches the per-server log as a child
//     line. The producers stamp every child line with `child_output=true`
//     (ChildOutputField), and a child-output record that mentions a container
//     id, a canonical container name or Docker's name-conflict phrase
//     (containerMentionPattern) is withheld unless it carries a matching
//     `container_owner` — which child output never does. The check runs over
//     the decoded CHILD-CONTROLLED values only (attributionChildMessageField
//     / attributionChildErrorField: the `message` field the stderr and
//     launcher producers write the child's line into, and the `error` field
//     of a record whose error re-emits the recent-stderr buffer — the
//     "Connection failed" record, codex round 3), never over the serialized
//     line: the writer stamp of a server that is
//     itself named like a container (`mcpproxy-tenant-abcd`) is not a
//     subject, so its ordinary child output stays attributable.
//
