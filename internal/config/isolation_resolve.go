// ResolveIsolation resolves the effective isolation state for a server,

//
// It lives in `config` rather than `upstream/core` so that every surface which
// has to answer "is this server isolated" — the spawn path, the REST/MCP
// projections, and the contracts converter (which cannot import core without a
// cycle) — provably runs one algorithm. `core.IsolationManager.ResolveIsolation`
// wraps this to add the deduplicated ignored-opt-in warning.
//
// Precedence:
//  1. A per-server explicit Mode wins outright (even over a disabled global) —
//     mirroring how other per-server overrides (image, network) take priority.
//  2. Otherwise, when the global mode resolves to none, per-server bool opt-ins
//     are ignored, preserving the pre-mode behavior.
//  3. When the global mode is active, a per-server bool opt-out (enabled:false)
//     downgrades the server to none. A nil Enabled is "inherit", NOT an opt-out.
//
// Structural gates then apply to ALL non-none modes: servers with no command
// (HTTP transports) and servers that already invoke docker are never isolated.
//
// A final CAPABILITY gate decides Isolated (not Mode): a mode the launcher does
// not implement, and "sandbox" on a host that cannot enforce Landlock, both run
// the server unconfined, so they must not be reported as isolated. Mode is left
// alone there because the spawn path branches on it and still applies the
// sandbox wrapper's rlimits on Linux — see isolationDelivered.
//
// This answers ONLY the process-spawn question. Two neighbouring questions have

// It shares ResolveIsolation's config precedence verbatim — the per-server
// `isolation.mode` override still wins outright, a disabled global still
// ignores per-server bool opt-ins, and an active global still honours a
// per-server `enabled:false` opt-out — so an operator's explicit security
// policy keeps deciding whether Docker scanners run. What it deliberately does
// NOT apply are the two STRUCTURAL gates, which exist purely to protect process
// spawning:
//
//   - not-stdio: an HTTP/SSE server has no child process for us to wrap, so
//     there is nothing to containerise — but a scanner container does not wrap
//     the server, it reads JSON captured over MCP;
//   - already-docker: wrapping a command that itself invokes docker would break
//     its access to the Docker socket — but a scanner container is a separate,
//     short-lived process that never touches the server's own container.
//
// Routing those gates into the scanner question forced mode=none for every
// remote server, silently skipped every Docker-based scanner plugin, and made
// the skip message's own remedy ("set isolation.mode to docker for this
// server") a dead end because the gate ignored that override too.
//
// It also skips the host-CAPABILITY gate (isolationDelivered), which refines
// ResolvedIsolation.Isolated and never Mode — matching what ResolveMode returns.
//
// See also: ResolveIsolation (how is this server's process launched) and
// ServerDependsOnDocker (does STARTING this server need a Docker daemon). The
// three are distinct questions and must stay distinct (GH #1142, GH #1303).
//
// The returned source is one of the IsolationSource* constants — never
