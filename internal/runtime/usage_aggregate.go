// Spec 069 A2: actor-owned usage aggregate.
//
// UsageAggregate is an in-memory rollup of tool-call activity, owned by the
// ActivityService goroutine and mutated incrementally via Apply. Readers never
// touch the live aggregate: the store publishes an immutable deep copy through
// an atomic pointer (copy-on-write), so reads are lock-free and never block.

// usageBucketWidth is the native time-bucket granularity for the timeline.
// Hourly matches the contract example (`start: ...T11:00:00Z`); the endpoint
// (A3) selects the requested window span over these buckets.

// default 90-day activity retention; older buckets are evicted oldest-first.

// latencyBucketBoundsMs are the inclusive upper bounds (in ms) of the fixed
// latency histogram buckets. A final overflow bucket captures anything slower
// than the last bound, so there are len(bounds)+1 buckets total.
//
// The low end is fine-grained on purpose. A percentile read off a histogram is
// the upper bound of the bucket it falls in, so the FIRST bound is the floor of
// everything the table can ever print: with 10ms as the first bound, an
// in-process stdio server answering in 3ms reported "p50 10 ms", "p95 10 ms" —
// every row of the latency table read exactly 10 ms while the Activity Log

// servers live almost entirely under 10ms, which is precisely where the old
