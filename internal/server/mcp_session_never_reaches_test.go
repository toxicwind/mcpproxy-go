// Spec 107 T068 (US1, FR-043(a)): regression pin, not a red test.
//
// FR-043(a) became true in PR-B (T052, mcpAuthMiddleware forced under
// config.EffectiveRequireMCPAuth) and is exercised at length by
// TestMCPAuthMiddleware_ForcedUnderServerEdition in mcp_auth_forced_test.go.
// This file is the T068 pin PR-C carries forward, covering two things that
// file does not:
//
//  1. every /mcp* route — not just "/mcp" — refuses a session cookie, a user
//     JWT, and (with server_edition.enabled forcing the effective value)
//     no credential at all, even when the raw require_mcp_auth field is set
//     to false;
//  2. the cache-authorization gate for a session principal
//     (cache/authorization.go:103, CallerKindUser) is never exercised on the
//     MCP path, because mcpAuthMiddleware never hands the downstream handler
//     an AuthContext of Type == auth.AuthTypeUser — pinned with a counter so
//     the assertion cannot pass vacuously on an empty case list, and proved
//     non-trivial by showing the same cache method DOES report CallerKindUser
//     for a UserContext (the shape a would-be session door would produce).
//
// Green on HEAD by design (PR-B already forces MCP auth); this file exists so
// a future change that reintroduces a session/JWT credential path on /mcp, or
// that starts handing MCP handlers a user-typed AuthContext, fails loudly
// here instead of silently reopening FR-043(a)/FR-003.
