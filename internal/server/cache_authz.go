// the effective profile (token pin > URL > session set_profile).

// keeps the "cache key not found" substring agents already handle, and the
// cache commits every refusal the way it commits a miss, so the timing class
// matches too. Storage failures (a bbolt error) stay distinct: they are
// operational faults, not answers about the key. So is an entry the header
// ADMITTED the caller to and that then proved unreadable (an undecodable or
// header-disagreeing body): the caller was entitled to it, the refusal shape
// is decided on the fixed header only, and every caller kind is told the
// entry is unreadable and has been invalidated (cache.ErrEntryUnreadable;
// codex round 6). A frame the header itself cannot vouch for is unrecognised
