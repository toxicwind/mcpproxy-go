// Informational Pass-1 baseline scanning.
//
// The spec-086 admission scan (maybeStartAdmissionScan) only fires for
// trust_mode:"scan" servers, which is never the default — so on a stock install
// nothing ever triggered the free, in-process TPA baseline scan and the security
// badges stayed empty forever. This file adds the two paths that fix that:
//
//  1. every NEW server, in ANY trust mode, gets one baseline scan when it is
//     admitted (maybeStartInformationalScans, driven by servers.changed), and
//  2. once per installation, pre-existing never-scanned servers are swept
//     (runBaselineSweep, driven by startup behind a persisted marker).
//
// Both are INFORMATIONAL: the result is stored through the normal scan-summary
// path so the UI verdict/badge lights up, and it drives NO gating whatsoever.
// Quarantine and approval semantics are untouched — servers the scan-mode
// admission gate owns are deliberately skipped here so they are never scanned
// twice, and the settle handler (maybeAutoApproveScanSettled) can only approve
// scan-mode quarantined servers, which this path never scans.

const (
	// informationalScanSettleTimeout bounds how long a serialized informational
	// scan waits for its verdict before moving to the next server. The wait is
	// what serializes the sweep — without it every scan would be launched at
	// once, since StartScan returns as soon as the job is created.
	informationalScanSettleTimeout = 2 * time.Minute
	// informationalScanPollInterval is how often the settle wait re-reads the
	// scan summary.
	informationalScanPollInterval = 250 * time.Millisecond
	// baselineSweepStartDelay holds the one-shot sweep back until upstream
	// servers have had a chance to connect. A scan of a still-connecting server
	// cannot export its tool definitions and fails outright, which would burn
	// the one-shot marker on an empty result.
	baselineSweepStartDelay = 45 * time.Second
	// maxInformationalScanAttempts caps how many times one server's informational
	// scan may be retried per process. StartScan fails outright for a server it
	// cannot connect to ("no source files available and server is disconnected"),
	// and that failure path costs up to ~60s inside StartScan (EnsureConnected +
	// a 30s connection wait, twice) while holding infoScanRunMu. Retrying is
	// worth it for a server that was merely still connecting; retrying forever on
	// every servers.changed for a permanently broken one would stall the queue
	// and respawn the upstream process endlessly. After the cap the server keeps
	// its "known" mark and is left to a manual scan.

// scanModeAdmissionOwns reports whether the spec-086 trust_mode:"scan" admission
// gate — and the settle-driven auto-approval behind it — is responsible for this
// server. Those servers must NOT be picked up by the informational path.
//
// The rule is deliberately the blunt one: EVERY trust_mode:"scan" server belongs
// to the gating path, whatever its quarantine state or approval history.
//
// Narrower predicates were tried and are unsafe, because every input the settle
// handler gates on is MUTABLE while a scan is in flight, and
// maybeAutoApproveScanSettled re-reads all of them when the verdict lands:
//
//   - Quarantine: a scan-mode server unquarantined at claim time that the
//     operator quarantines mid-scan gets silently unquarantined by the clean
//     settle.
//   - Approval baseline: a scan-mode server WITH a baseline (which the settle
//     handler would normally bail on) loses it if the operator rejects the
//     server mid-scan — POST .../reject calls RejectServer, which deletes the
//     integrity baseline — and the clean settle then auto-approves the very
//     server that was just rejected.
//
// Since the informational path's whole contract is that it can never cause a
// gating state change, it simply never scans a server the settle handler could
// act on. Scan-mode servers still get their verdict from the gating path's own
// admission scan, or from a manual scan.
//
// KNOWN RESIDUAL WINDOW (cross-model review, PR #1031). The predicate is
// evaluated when the scan is CLAIMED, but the settle handler re-reads
// everything — including the trust mode itself — when the verdict lands. So a
// server informationally scanned as manual/auto that the operator switches to
// trust_mode:"scan" AND quarantines while the scan is in flight can still reach
// maybeAutoApproveScanSettled and be auto-approved by that clean verdict. No
// predicate here can close it: the decision belongs to the settle handler, and
// this path has no say once StartScan has been issued.
//
// Not closed in this change because the only real fix is scan PROVENANCE — the
// settle handler acting solely on scans the gating path itself started — which
// means threading a scan id through the runtime event payload
// (publishScanSettled carries server_name/status/findings only) and into
// spec-086's gating path, whose semantics this change deliberately leaves
// untouched. The window is narrow and the outcome is policy-consistent (a
// scan-mode + quarantined + no-baseline + clean server is exactly what spec 086
// auto-approves), and ApproveServer(force=false) still re-gates independently.
//
// KNOWN COVERAGE GAP, same review: a trust_mode:"scan" server that is NOT
// quarantined (e.g. quarantine_enabled:false globally) is scanned by NEITHER
// path — this one skips all scan-mode servers, and the gating path only handles
// quarantined ones. Narrowing this predicate to match is what the two bullets
// above rule out, so closing that gap also needs provenance.
