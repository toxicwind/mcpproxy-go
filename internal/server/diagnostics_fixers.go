// Spec 044's self-heal buttons are backed by fixers registered in
// internal/diagnostics/builtin_fixers.go. That file's comment says the real
// implementations are "registered by higher layers at startup" — but until this
// file existed, NOTHING did: the only diagnostics.Register call outside the
// package was in a test. So every one of the four registered fixers was the
// placeholder, and the two that matter most in the field were dead:
//
//   - stdio_show_last_logs returned the canned string "log tail unavailable in
//     this build" with outcome=success. It is offered by
//     MCPX_STDIO_EXIT_BEFORE_INITIALIZE (270 installs) and
//     MCPX_STDIO_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT (315 installs), whose captured stderr
//     usually names the missing binary or env var outright — precisely what the
//     button promised and never delivered.
//   - oauth_reauth returned outcome=blocked for every execute. It is the ONLY
//     action MCPX_OAUTH_LOGIN_REQUIRED (208 installs) offers.
//
// Because the placeholder reported success, diagnostics.fix_succeeded_24h was
// counting placeholder no-ops. This file replaces both with the same calls the
// REST API already makes for the equivalent endpoints, so the counter starts
// measuring the product instead of the instrument.
//
// The two config-mutating placeholders (config_migrate_deprecated,
// server_disable_scanner) are deliberately left alone — mutating the user's
// config file from a one-click button is a larger design question than wiring
// an existing read path.

// diagnosticsLogTailLines is how many trailing log lines stdio_show_last_logs
// returns. It matches the default of the REST endpoint
// (GET /api/v1/servers/{id}/logs) and of the tail_log MCP tool.
const diagnosticsLogTailLines = 50

// diagnosticsPreviewMaxBytes bounds the rendered log tail.
//
// diagnosticsLogTailLines bounds the line COUNT, not the byte size, and a child
// MCP server is free to print a 60KB JSON blob on a single line (bufio.Scanner's
// default 64KB token limit is the only ceiling GetServerLogs imposes). This
// Preview is delivered as a Web-UI notification, not into a log viewer, so 50
// such lines would be a multi-megabyte toast. The cap keeps the NEWEST lines —
// a tail is read bottom-up — and the fixer states plainly what it dropped, so
// nothing goes missing silently.
//
// One documented exemption: the single newest line is never dropped or
// truncated, so a payload can exceed this when that one line does. That is
// deliberate (it is the line that explains the failure) and it is the ONLY way
// past the cap — the header and the omission notice are budgeted for.

// registerDiagnosticFixers installs the runtime-backed fixer implementations
// over the package-level placeholders. Called from NewServerWithConfigPath,
// where both dependencies (this *Server for logs, the Runtime for OAuth) are
// already constructed.
//
// diagnostics.Register is process-global and last-write-wins. Production builds
// one Server per process, so the binding is unambiguous there; in a test binary
// that constructs several, the most recently constructed Server owns the
// fixers. That is the same contract the package's own init() already had.

// because the FixResult crosses the REST API: the per-server log file is

// fixOAuthReauth implements the "Sign in" / "Log in again" button.
//
// It calls Runtime.TriggerOAuthLogin (async, hands off to
// Manager.StartManualOAuth, returns as soon as the flow's goroutine is
// launched) behind an explicit read_only_mode / disable_management check.
//
// Both halves of that are deliberate, and each was wrong on its own:
//
//   - WITHOUT the gate check, a one-click button started an OAuth flow on an
//     install whose owner had turned management off. POST
//     /api/v1/servers/{id}/login cannot: it goes through the management
//     service, whose checkWriteGates refuses both settings
//     (internal/management/service.go). The diagnostics route's middleware
//     checks caller authorization, not those config gates, so nothing else
//     was applying them here. The predicate is duplicated rather than called
//     because checkWriteGates is unexported and the only exported entry point
//     behind it is TriggerOAuthLoginQuick — which is the other half:
//   - Routing through TriggerOAuthLoginQuick to inherit the gate looked
//     tidier and is WRONG for this caller. StartManualOAuthQuick runs startup
//     synchronously under its own 30-minute background context, so the fix
//     endpoint's 15s deadline stops bounding the call; its watcher cancels
//     the callback context after ~120s, so a slow 2FA loses the flow it was
//     told had started; HasRecentOAuthCompletion can make that watcher exit
//     on its FIRST poll when the same server signed in within five minutes;
//     and it drops the SSE dispatch that ForceOAuthFlowWithResult performs,
//     so an OAuth-protected legacy SSE endpoint fails to initialize instead
//     of opening its flow. The REST login route accepts all of that; a
//     one-click fixer with a 15s budget must not.
//
// The message therefore does not claim a browser window opened — nothing on
// this path reports whether one did, and the placeholder this file replaced is
// exactly what asserting an unverified success looks like.
//
// Duplicate clicks: Manager.StartManualOAuth builds a fresh core client per
// invocation, so the isOAuthInProgress check is per-client. An earlier version
// of this comment claimed a second click "surfaces as an error string rather
// than a second browser tab"; that guarantee is stronger than the code
// provides. Whatever the real behaviour is, it is a pre-existing property of
// StartManualOAuth and is not changed here.
//
// Gating is unchanged: every catalog entry that offers this fixer marks the
// step Destructive (except MCPX_OAUTH_LOGIN_REQUIRED's first-time "Sign in",
// where there is no stored credential to lose), so handleInvokeFix still
// demands an explicit mode (409 otherwise) and the Web UI's ErrorPanel still
// gates Execute behind window.confirm().

// An earlier wording sent a user with no browser window to "Show last server

// the authorization URL and the browser-launch failure are written by the
// client's main logger (connection_oauth.go, c.logger), which does not feed
// that file — and the OAuth catalog entries do not offer the log-tail button
// in the first place. The instruction pointed at a log that never held the
// URL, behind a button the user could not press.
//
// `mcpproxy auth login --server=<name>` is the fallback: it starts the same
// flow again from a terminal, which is the right retry for a browser launch
// that failed transiently. It is NOT promised to print the authorization URL:
// with the daemon running the CLI takes daemon mode, and although the REST
// login response carries auth_url and browser_opened
// (httpapi/server.go handleServerLogin), cliclient.TriggerOAuthLogin discards
// both and cmd/mcpproxy/auth_cmd.go prints a generic success line. Only the
// standalone path prints the URL. Surfacing auth_url through the CLI is a
// separate change; until it lands, the message claims only what the command
