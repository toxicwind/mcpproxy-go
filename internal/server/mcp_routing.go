	//     FR-008), and the LISTING filters read that stamp first, never a fresh
	//     catalog lookup — so an ADDED, REMOVED, reverse-flipped or tier-changed
	//     name is authorized correctly for every caller, scoped or not, as soon
	//     as SetTools lands it, with no window at all.
	//   - describe_tool is UNCHANGED by that fix and still resolves against
	//     whichever catalog generation `p.loadDirectCatalog()` currently
	//     returns, so it can lag the listing for the width of this window —
	//     two OPPOSITE, both accepted, transient cross-generation residuals
	//     that close at the publish: an added name is listed but not yet
	//     describable (the direction Spec 102's SC-007 forbids in steady
	//     state, tolerated here only for this one-rebuild window), and a
	//     removed name is still describable from the previous snapshot after
	//     it drops off the listing (stale, not a disclosure — the same
	//     session could have described it one request earlier).
	//
	// Both close at the publish. The three accepted residuals (T002/T003) are
	// the schema- and annotations-only changes, which are invisible in the
	// listing by construction.
	// Skip a rebuild that would change nothing. SetTools notifies every client
