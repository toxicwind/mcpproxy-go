// Issue #1148: `quarantine_security list_quarantined` json.Marshal'd the raw
// []*config.ServerConfig straight out of storage, so every credential the
// struct carries — env values, header values, oauth.client_secret, URL query
// credentials and argv tokens — travelled out of the MCP surface in the clear,
// to any caller, and was then recorded verbatim into the activity store.
//
// The durable fix is not "mask the five fields the report named". It is to stop
// MCP-facing payloads being built from the config struct at all, and build them
// from a REDACTED VIEW instead, so the NEXT field added to ServerConfig is
// masked by default rather than leaked by default.
//
// The view is deliberately NOT a hand-written key list. An allowlist is exactly
// what rotted into #1146 (the activity record that dropped every payload field)
// and what makes this class of bug recur: it encodes today's field set and
// silently omits tomorrow's. Instead the config is marshalled through its own
// MarshalJSON and the resulting generic map is walked by the shared redaction
// walker from mcp_activity_args.go, whose rules are keyed on field NAMES and,
// for every leaf that survives that, on the VALUE's own shape.
//
// WARNING: the view must stay a map. config.ServerConfig declares
// MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON, and Go promotes those to any struct that embeds
// it — an embedding wrapper silently drops its own fields on encode (see the
// warning on config.ServerConfig.UnmarshalJSON).

// redactedServerView renders one server config as a generic JSON map with every
// secret-bearing leaf masked under the given policy.
//
// Pass liveRedaction for an interactive MCP read surface (keeps the
// `••••<last2> (<N> chars)` rendering the patch-path unmaskers recognise) and
// auditRedaction for anything persisted. Returns nil for a nil config.
//
// It is a thin alias for oauth.RedactedServerConfigView. The rule moved into
// internal/oauth beside the leaf rules and the walk once a THIRD door onto
// config.ServerConfig turned up — the server edition's
// `GET /api/v1/user/servers`, which embeds the struct in its ServerResponse and
// cannot import internal/server. A rule reachable from only some of its doors
// is what every round of #1148 has been.

// Issue #1148, round 3: argv masks are NEVER reverted. They are REFUSED.
//
// The write path used to restore a masked argv token from the stored vector
// (`unmaskArgv`), first by VALUE (round 2 finding 1) and then bound to the
// index plus the preceding flag (round 3 finding 1). Both leaked, and the
// second one leaked for a reason no tightening of the argv-internal context can
// remove:
//
//   - An argv token has NO KEY. env values bind to the variable name, headers
//     to the header name, a URL secret to its scheme+host — each is a piece of
//     context the caller cannot restate without also restating what the secret
//     is FOR. An argv slot has only its index and its neighbours.
//   - The caller supplies the WHOLE vector *and* `command` in the same patch.
//     So every candidate binding is caller-controlled: an index is chosen, a
//     preceding flag is copied verbatim, and even a byte-identical argv means
//     nothing once `command` moves from `mcp-foo` to `curl`. There is no
//     surrounding context that proves the slot still means what it meant when
//     the value was masked.
//   - The index-plus-flag binding also missed every mask the VALUE-shaped
//     detector produced (`ghp_…****`) and every mask at index 0, because
//     nothing but the index bound those at all:
//         stored   = ["mcp-foo", "run", "ghp_…"]
//         incoming = ["--silent", "--data", "ghp_…****"]
//     restored the live token into an attacker-chosen command line.
//
// So the revert is gone. A client that echoes a mask back is told to resend the
// real value instead, which is the one answer that is safe in both directions:
// the secret never moves (no relocation), and the mask is never written over
// the credential either (no read-modify-write corruption — the #1142/#1146
// failure the revert was added to prevent).
//
// Refusing rather than silently keeping the stored vector is deliberate:
// `args_json` REPLACES the vector, so silently ignoring it would make the write
// look applied when it was not.
