// outright whenever it exists — with the single never-baselined exception
// described below.
//
// What remains to be reconciled is the store a pre-105 binary left behind:
// discovery used to file a raw name that carries a ":" segment under the
// COLLAPSED key — everything after the first colon, so "ns:erase" landed
// under "erase". Such a record is ambiguous on its face: it may describe the
// raw "ns:erase" that produced it, or a genuine sibling tool "erase". Nothing
// rewrites it (research D4, tool_quarantine.go: guessing would be a silent
// approval); instead a legacy collapsed record APPROVES only the raw name it
// stores. Read for a namespaced name it can therefore only RESTRICT: its
// quarantine lock (pending / changed) and its user Disabled flag still bind
// the namespaced tool — a tool that was locked or disabled at every instant
// must not become callable because its record sits under the old key — while
// an approved, enabled legacy record is reported as "no record", so the
// namespaced tool stays pending under an active gate until it is approved by
// its own name (the first discovery after upgrade files that exact record).
//
// One exact-record shape does NOT win outright: an APPROVED exact record whose
// ApprovedHash is EMPTY. The pre-105 user toggle (runtime setToolEnabledNoEmit)
// synthesized exactly that record under the exact raw name whenever the
// operator toggled a namespaced tool, while discovery kept the tool's real
// quarantine lock under the collapsed key — so until the first discovery
// after upgrade re-files it (runtime adoptLegacyLockOrBaseline), the exact
// record carries the user's visibility intent and no approval decision at
// all. For that shape, and only that shape, a restricting collapsed sibling
// still binds: the merge is re-admitted narrowly, with the sibling's lock and
// the union of both Disabled flags on the exact identity.

// under "erase" is the genuine "erase" tool's own record and lends nothing to
// "ns:erase" on either branch.
