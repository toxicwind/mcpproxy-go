// Codex round 6 (PR E), docker findings 1–3 (Spec 105 FR-007 / research D9,
// moment-of-mutation rule): the core's image-fallback, name-pattern and
// pre-creation cleanups established ownership by a LISTING and consumed it
// on a LATER stop / rm -f, and stopOwnedContainer's kill after a failed stop
// was a second mutation with no read at all. Another Docker client can
// rename or relabel a container — or replace it under an id that extends
// the listed one — between the listing and the command. Every mutation now
// re-reads that one container's full id, name and label immediately before
// the command (ContainerMutator, the one verify-then-mutate implementation
// the manager sweeps share): a container that no longer satisfies the
// predicate is left alone and the refusal recorded without its id or name;
// one that still does is mutated, and every record naming it carries
// container_owner from that mutation-time read.

// ownFixtureNamed is one container under id as name/owner label say. It
// always carries this test process's own instance label: these tests vary
// name/owner to probe the server-name-and-canonical-name half of ownership,
// not the instance half (TestOwnsContainer_Predicate and
