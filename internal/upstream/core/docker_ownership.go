// Spec 105 FR-007 (gap FR007-G5, research D9): canonical container ownership.
//
// Every container mcpproxy creates is named `mcpproxy-<sanitised>-<4 chars>`
// (generateContainerName) and labelled `com.mcpproxy.server=<raw name>`
// (formatContainerLabels). The name alone is NOT ownership evidence: `a/b`
// and `a-b` both sanitise to `a-b`, and `a`'s old prefix filter
// (`name=mcpproxy-a-`) is a substring match that also lists `a-b`'s
// containers. Pre-105 every cleanup path removed those foreign containers
// and wrote their ids and names into `a`'s per-server log, which
// `upstream_servers tail_log` serves to an `a`-scoped agent.
//
// A container is owned by server S, on THIS mcpproxy instance, iff ALL hold:
//   - its com.mcpproxy.server label equals S's raw name exactly,
//   - its com.mcpproxy.instance label equals this process's own instance id
//     (core.GetInstanceID(), instance.go) exactly, and
//   - its name matches ^mcpproxy-<sanitised(S)>-[a-z0-9]{4}$ (the regex guards
//     against a foreign process re-using the label).
//
// The instance check matters even though every reader here is scoped to one
// server name: two separate mcpproxy processes (distinct data dirs) can both
// configure a server literally named `a`, and without it either instance's
// cleanup would stop, kill or rm the OTHER instance's live container for
// that name — a container neither created nor is otherwise entitled to touch
// (the vulnerability class this file exists to close, now recurring one
// level up: server-name-scoped but not instance-scoped is exactly as
// canonical as name-scoped but not label-scoped was pre-105).
//
// Docker applies all three filters server-side (`--filter label=` is an
// exact match, `--filter name=` a regexp match) and ownsContainer re-checks
// them in Go, so no container that fails any of them is ever mutated or
// logged. Pre-label containers, containers from another instance, and
// user-`--name` containers are all left alone: they never were ours by this
// rule. That holds on EVERY stop/kill/rm path, including the two that
// start from a single known container rather than a listing (codex round 1):
// the id read from the cidfile of this server's own `docker run` — a
// user-configured direct `docker run --name custom` gets a cidfile but no
// label and no canonical name — and the exact tracked name. Both look the
// container up (lookupOwnedContainerByID / lookupOwnedContainerByName) and
// apply ownsContainer before acting and before writing a record. Every
// housekeeping record that names a container carries `container_owner` — the
// label value READ BACK from Docker, never the requesting server's name — so
// the attributed log reader (internal/logs, D8 rule 3) can prove the subject
// belongs to the requested server; that field is the only
// administrator-visible change (SC-005).
//
// Ownership is a fact about NOW, not about a listing (codex rounds 5 and 6):
// another Docker client can rename or relabel a container — or replace it
// under an id that extends the listed one — between the `docker ps` that
// found it and the stop/kill/rm that acts on it. So every mutation, on every
// path here and in the manager's sweeps, goes through ContainerMutator: it
// re-reads that one container's FULL id, name and label immediately before
// the command, applies the predicate again, refuses (naming no id) when it
// no longer holds, and hands back the row it read so the caller's records
// carry container_id and container_owner from that read alone.

// containerOwnerLabel is the Docker label carrying the RAW server name of the
// mcpproxy server a container was created for (formatContainerLabels).
const containerOwnerLabel = "com.mcpproxy.server"

// containerInstanceLabel is the Docker label carrying this mcpproxy
// PROCESS's instance id (formatContainerLabels, instance.go). Two mcpproxy
// instances on one Docker host can each configure a server with the same
// name — distinct data dirs, distinct config.db, but nothing stops the same
// server name appearing in both — and before this label was checked here,
// ownsContainer admitted either instance's container for that name (codex
// round: FR-007 canonical ownership was server-name-scoped but not
// instance-scoped, so it was neither canonical across instances nor immune
// to two COOPERATING mcpproxy processes colliding on a name). That is the
// gap this label closes.
//
// It does NOT, and cannot, make ownership cryptographically unforgeable
// against a fully Docker-capable adversary (codex round 2): Docker labels
// are plain, uninterpreted, unauthenticated string metadata — anyone who
// can run `docker run --label` can copy this instance's real id verbatim
// (readable off any of its own containers with a plain `docker inspect`,
// no guessing required) onto a container of their own. That actor already
// holds the Docker socket, i.e. is already equivalent to root on this
// host's containers; no label scheme defeats them, and the pre-existing
// com.mcpproxy.server check never claimed to either (ContainerOwnedByAny's
// own doc: "which any foreign container can copy"). FR-007's canonical
// ownership is scoped to distinguishing mcpproxy's OWN legitimate
// containers — between configured servers, and now between live mcpproxy
// instances — not to authenticating labels against a host-level attacker;
// that would need a different mechanism entirely (signed labels, or state

// renamed, relabelled or reused under that id since it was tracked is left
// alone (codex round 3). owned reports whether the predicate admitted the
// container (removal was attempted) and owner is then the
// com.mcpproxy.server label read back at that moment — the evidence the
// caller's own records must carry when they name the container (D8, codex
// round 5); err is the docker error when removal ran and failed, or the
// lookup error. Records carry container_owner from the label read back; an
