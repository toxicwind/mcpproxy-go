// The activity log holds several populations of record, and only one of them is
// "a call the user made". Everything the product prints as a count of CALLS —
// the Activity Log header, the Usage tab's tiles, the histogram under them, the
// tray glance, the CLI — has to count that one population, or the same instance
// reports different totals for the same window on two screens sitting side by
// side (audit finding F1, #1046: 51 vs 25 vs 19).
//
// CountsAsCall is that definition, and it lives here — in the package both the
// aggregate (internal/runtime) and the REST handlers (internal/httpapi) already
// depend on — so there is exactly one copy of it.

// glanceDiscoveryBuiltins are the built-ins whose SUCCESSFUL calls are rows the
// user sees (tray GlanceSelection.swift rule 3, mirrored by the usage
// timeline): retrieve_tools and describe_tool. code_execution is deliberately
// absent — it is an internal primitive, and the upstream calls its scripts make
// are tool_call records that count on their own, so counting the wrapper too
// would double a script under a name no upstream owns. A FAILED code_execution
// still counts, through the failure branch below: it dispatched nothing, so its
// own record is the only trace of the attempt.

	"retrieve_tools": true,
	"describe_tool":  true,

// glanceManagementBuiltins never appear in the glance at all (rule 1), whatever
// their status: they are mcpproxy's own housekeeping, not work the user asked
// an upstream for. Keep this set in lockstep with the Swift one.

	"upstream_servers":    true,
	"quarantine_security": true,

// IsManagementBuiltin reports whether a record is one of mcpproxy's own
// management built-ins (upstream_servers / quarantine_security) rather than
// something a user asked an upstream for.
//
// It is the same population CountsAsCall excludes above, exported because the
// per-server aggregation needs it too: issue #1146 gave these rows a
// target_server so the Activity Log could render a Server column and --server
// could filter on it, and without this predicate a burst of config edits would
// then read as traffic TO the server being configured — and "github:
// upstream_servers" would show up as one of github's busiest tools.

// CountsAsCall reports whether a record is one of the calls the user made, and
// whether that call is a failure.
//
// Admission, by record type:
//
//   - tool_call — an upstream dispatch. Counts, except when it was shed by a
//     concurrency limiter (spec 093 "rejected"): a shed call never executed and
//     never reached an upstream, so it is backpressure, not traffic. A "blocked"
//     dispatch (a policy refused a code_execution sub-call) counts as a failed
//     call: the user made it and did not get it.
//   - internal_tool_call — one of mcpproxy's own built-ins. The call_tool_*
//     variants are excluded because every one of them duplicates a canonical
//     record: a dispatched call — succeeded or failed — also emits its own
//     tool_call record under the same request id, and a shed one is already
//     written by the concurrency limiter. This is the same exclusion
//     ActivityFilter.ExcludeCallToolSuccess applies to the list, so the counter
//     and the rows it counts agree. Management built-ins never count. The rest
//     count when they failed, and on success only for the discovery built-ins
//     the user actually sees.
//   - policy_decision — counts only when a policy blocked or shed the attempt,
//     as a failed call. An allow decision is bookkeeping about a call that is
//     already counted through its own tool_call record.
//
// Every other type — system_start, security_scan, quarantine and config
// changes, prompt fetches — is an EVENT. Those belong in the Activity Log, and
// the log's row count is a real number; it just is not a count of calls.
