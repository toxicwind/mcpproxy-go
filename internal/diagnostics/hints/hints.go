// the same way. Each used to (or would) hand-roll the Docker-isolation
// predicate, and a hand-rolled mirror has already drifted from the spawn path
// once (GH #1142): a `mode: "docker"` server was Docker-launched but classified
// as a plain host ENOENT. Since GH #1145 the classification decides whether a
// server is parked as terminally failed, a drift now changes retry behaviour and
// not just a help message.

//
// The Docker predicate delegates to config.ResolveIsolation — the SAME resolver
// the spawn path branches on (core.IsolationManager.ShouldIsolate wraps it) — so
// the hint cannot drift from the launch decision. The predicate is
// Mode == docker, not ResolvedIsolation.Isolated: the DOCKER remediation codes
// describe the container LAUNCH path, which runs whenever the mode is docker.
//
// The enrichment fields (command, image override, default images) only feed
// MCP-2909's runtime-aware remediation text; they never change classification.
//
// The transport is canonicalized HERE, at the one place every production hint
// is built, rather than at each of the classifier's gates. Callers pass
// transport.DetermineTransportType's output, which returns config.Protocol
// VERBATIM — so the same HTTP server arrives as "http", "sse",
// "streamable-http" or "auto" depending only on how it was added, and the
// classifier's HTTP arms (gated on the literal "http") were switched off for
// every spelling but one. See diagnostics.CanonicalTransport.
