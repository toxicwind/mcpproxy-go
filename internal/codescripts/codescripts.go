// Package codescripts resolves and lists server-side stored scripts for the
// code_execution tool (Spec 097).
//
// A stored script is a file named `<name>.js` or `<name>.ts` in the `scripts/`
// directory next to the ACTIVE configuration file. Callers address it by base
// NAME — never by path — and this package is the single owner of what a name
// may be, how it maps to a file, and what a usable script file looks like.
//
// Confinement is the name validator, not the filesystem walk: a token-valid
// name contains no separators and no dots, so joining it to the scripts
// directory cannot escape that directory by construction (FR-003 / SC-003).
// ValidateName therefore runs before any filesystem call. On top of that
// boundary sits a symlink/non-regular POLICY, made atomic where the platform
// allows it (Unix O_NOFOLLOW) and best-effort where it does not (Windows).
//
// Nothing here caches: each Resolve performs one open and one bounded read, so
// an atomic replacement of a script file is visible to the very next
// invocation with nothing to invalidate (FR-009).
