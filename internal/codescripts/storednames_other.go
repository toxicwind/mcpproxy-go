// Linux and the BSDs resolve names case-sensitively on their native
// filesystems, but a case-folding mount (vfat, an ext4 casefold directory, a
// bind mount from a case-insensitive host) finds `backdoor.JS` for
// `backdoor.js` just as the default APFS volume does — and unlike APFS
// (F_GETPATH) they offer no single-entry call that reports how an entry is
// spelled on disk: a readlink of /proc/self/fd/N echoes the spelling that
// was looked up, not the one stored. The only exact answer is the directory
// listing, and a listing paid on a scoped caller's request is what Spec 105
// FR-012 forbids: its cost grows with the directory, and paying it only when
// a probe hits (codex r5 #1) made the presence of a differently cased entry
// cost O(directory) while absence cost O(1) — a timing oracle on the stored
// names.
//
// Round 13 (round-10 finding 1 and finding 3): darwin answers from this same
// index rather than a per-request F_GETPATH probe. F_GETPATH is real and
// exact, so darwin's OWN probe never had a case-folding blind spot — but it
// answered a hit (Lstat succeeds, then entryName) and a miss (Lstat alone)
// with a DIFFERENT number of platform calls, which is exactly the timing
// oracle finding 3 named: a scoped caller could distinguish "no entry" from
// "a case-variant exists" by latency alone, whatever a non-disclosing
// refusal's contract (SC-005) requires. Answering darwin from the index too
// makes an absent name and a present case-variant both plain index MISSES —
// identical work, an O(1) map lookup, neither one reaching Fstatat — closing
// the oracle the same way it is already closed for Linux/BSD. See
// dirfd_other.go's own round-13 note for why no darwin-specific generation
// reader was needed to do this, and entryname_darwin.go for the
// belt-and-suspenders F_GETPATH proof darwin keeps on top of this index.
//
// So the scoped resolver answers from a stored-name INDEX instead: the exact
// spellings a scripts directory holds, maintained OFF the request path. The
// index is built when the server learns its scripts directory (Warm) and
// rebuilt by a single-flight goroutine whenever a request finds it behind the
// directory's GENERATION. No request ever lists: it answers from the index
// that exists — an exact hit is re-probed by the candidate's own no-follow
// stat and opened no-follow, so a removed or replaced file fails closed; a
// script added since the listing is refused until the rebuild lands,
// milliseconds later (the administrator's directory read sees it at once).
// Every request — hit, miss or case-variant, cold or warm, in a directory of
// ten thousand entries or none — costs the same bounded number of directory
// primitives and an O(1) set lookup. Listing cost follows the
// administrator's writes, never the requested name, and never lands on a
// caller's goroutine.
//
// The index answers ONLY for the generation it was built against (round 8
// MUST-FIX): a stale index is refused exactly as a never-built one is, fail
// closed, until its own rebuild lands (a call landing within milliseconds of
// a directory change is refused once — retry). The generation is checked
// once more after an exact-set hit's no-follow open (round 8 MUST-FIX, the
// lookup→open race): gen-before == index.gen == gen-after is what proves the
// file the open just read is the one the index vouched for.
//
// A matching generation is not enough on its own (round 9 MUST-FIX): a
// coarse filesystem timestamp (vfat: two seconds) can leave a directory's
// stamp UNCHANGED across a rename that lands in the same tick as the stamp
// the index was listed against. An index may therefore AUTHORIZE a hit only
// once it is SETTLED: its stamp predates the listing by at least
// generationSettleTime, so no write still landing on that stamp could have
// escaped it.
//
// Round 11 MUST-FIX (the directory-path ABA hole): every check above —
// gen-before, the candidate probe, gen-after — and the eventual open used to
// be FOUR INDEPENDENT resolutions of scriptsDir BY PATH. A replaceable
// symlink, ancestor directory, or bind mount retargeted between two of those
// steps and back before the next one let each step separately agree with a
// DIFFERENT directory than the one the others saw — st_dev (round 9) rules
// out a substitution visible during one snapshot, never an alternation
// across several. The fix (dirfd_other.go) binds the entire request to ONE
// retained directory descriptor: opened by path exactly once, then every
// generation read, the candidate probe, and the open itself are all
// performed RELATIVE TO THAT DESCRIPTOR (fstat / fstatat / openat) — no
// second path resolution exists for anything to retarget. See
// dirfd_other.go for the full account and storedSpellingsOf below for where
// the descriptor is opened and released.
//
// Round 11 SHOULD (cancellable rebuilds): a directory that keeps changing
// must not leave orphaned rebuild goroutines running forever after their
// index has been evicted (LRU) or pruned (Warm keeping only the active
// directory) — each index owns a context that eviction cancels, and its
// rebuild goroutine (the ASYNC, request-scheduled kind only — Warm's own
// synchronous rebuild is what the caller is waiting on and always runs to
// completion) checks it between listing attempts and once more before
// installing a result, so a cancelled rebuild stops promptly and writes
// nothing nobody will read. See storedNames.rebuild below.
