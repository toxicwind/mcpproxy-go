// This file is the round 11 MUST-FIX for the Linux/BSD directory-path ABA
// hole: every earlier round's scoped resolution re-resolved scriptsDir BY
// PATH at each step of one request — once to read the directory's
// generation, once per candidate to probe it, once more after the open to
// recheck the generation — and openScriptFile's own no-follow open resolved
// the path a FOURTH time to obtain the descriptor that is actually read.
// Four independent path resolutions leave a window between each pair of
// them: retarget a replaceable symlink, an ancestor directory, or a bind
// mount to a different directory B between two of those steps and back to
// the original A before the next one, and whichever step happens to run
// while the path points at A agrees with everything the index vouches for
// while the step that runs during the B window reads or opens B's content
// instead — st_dev (round 9) rules out a substitution visible DURING one
// snapshot, never an alternation across several snapshots taken at
// different moments.
//
// The fix binds the whole scoped resolution to ONE retained directory
// descriptor per request (storedSpellingsOf, storednames_other.go): the
// scripts directory is opened by path exactly ONCE (openScopedDir); its
// generation is read from THAT descriptor (fstatDirGeneration — an fstat,
// never another Lstat of the path); a candidate is probed relative to the
// SAME descriptor (fstatatEntry, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW — the no-follow
// counterpart of Lstat, but resolved against the retained fd rather than a
// fresh join of the path); the winning candidate is OPENED relative to the
// SAME descriptor (openatEntry) — so the directory entry Fstatat already
// probed is the exact one Openat opens, never a second, independent lookup
// of the name that a retargeted symlink could have answered differently;
// and the post-open recheck reads the generation from the SAME descriptor
// once more. No path is resolved twice, so nothing about the sequence can
// observe two different directories. The request's own cost stays O(1):
// one open, two fstats (one before the lookup, one after the open), one
// fstatat, one openat.
//
// The rebuild goroutine (storednames_other.go, off the request path) opens
// its own descriptor the same way and lists through it (listScopedDir), so
// the listing and the generation the index records for it come from the
// identical open — never a second resolution of the path either.
//
// Round 13 (unify darwin onto this design; round-10 finding 1, and finding 3
// — the case-variant timing oracle — for free): darwin now builds this build
// tag list too (`unix`, below) rather than opening a fresh path-based
// probe per request the way storedspellings_probe.go used to. x/sys/unix's
// Stat_t already spells the ctime field Mtim/Ctim uniformly across every
// platform `unix` covers — including darwin, unlike the standard library's
// syscall.Stat_t, which spells it Mtimespec/Ctimespec there — so
// defaultFstatDirGeneration below needs no darwin-specific variant. Darwin's
// own F_GETPATH stays in service as an ADDITIONAL, belt-and-suspenders proof
// on the opened descriptor (entryname_darwin.go, wired onto
// storednames_other.go's extraVerifyOpened hook) — openat's identity
// binding already proves the parent, so only the basename is worth
// re-checking.
//
// Round 13 SHOULD (finding 6 — plan9/js/wasip1 do not build): the `unix`
// build constraint (recognized by cmd/go for every real Unix GOOS; see
// https://pkg.go.dev/go/build#hdr-Build_Constraints) replaces the former
// `!darwin && !windows`, which also matched plan9, js/wasip1 and any future
// non-Unix GOOS — none of which have an x/sys/unix package to import. The
// package still builds for those targets: fallback_other.go
// (`!unix && !windows`) supplies a ResolveScoped that fails closed
// (non-disclosing not-found, matching this file's own fail-closed answer to
// an unreadable directory) and a no-op Warm, so a plan9 or js/wasm build of
// the module compiles without ever being able to serve a scoped stored
// script on those targets.
//
// Every primitive below is a variable so the package's tests can install a
// real symlink retarget between two of a request's own calls (the actual
// window the fix closes is between separate Go statements the caller makes,
// not inside a single syscall) and, for the narrower races a real retarget
// cannot land deterministically, hook the exact call the race would need to
// win.
