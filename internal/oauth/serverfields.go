// `quarantine_security list_quarantined` payloads are built from.
//
// Issue #1148, round 4 finding 3 put the FIELD LIST here. Round 6 finding 2
// put the RULES here too: this function used to apply name-rule-only redaction
// (RedactEnvValues / RedactStringHeaders / RedactURLQueryParams) while the MCP
// door applied the name rule PLUS the value-shaped detector, so a credential
// under a benign env/header name — or under an unrecognised URL query
// parameter — was masked on one door and published in the clear on the other.
// Sharing a field list but not the rules is the same half-done shape this issue
// keeps producing; both now come from LiveRedaction.
//
// There are THREE doors onto this struct — `GET /api/v1/servers` and its
// single-server children, the `/events` SSE `servers.changed` payload, and the
// tray/Web UI reading either. Parity between them is load-bearing beyond the
// leak: the Web UI's mergeServers treats each payload as authoritative, so a
// masked-vs-plaintext mismatch between the list response and the SSE delivery
// would flicker on every event.
//
// Callers apply the `reveal_secret_headers` opt-out themselves; by the time a
// server reaches here it is being redacted.
//
// The write-path answer for every field is recorded ONCE, in
// ServerFieldMaskDecisions below, and enforced by the write doors through
// UnmaskLiveEnvValues / UnmaskLiveHeaders / UnmaskLiveURL / UnmaskLiveOAuth
// plus the CheckServerWriteMasks residual net.
