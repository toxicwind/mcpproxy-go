// Issue #1148, round 8 — the structural check the previous seven rounds needed.
//
// Every round of this review found the same shape: a rule applied at one door
// and not at its sibling. Rounds 5, 6, 7 and 8 each fixed the doors that were
// reported and left the next one open, because nothing enumerated the doors. A
// DOOR is any function that puts a server-derived string onto a wire a client
// can read — an MCP tool response, a REST handler, an SSE payload, CLI JSON,
// diagnostics, status/stats, the tray adapter, the server edition.
//
// The scan below finds them from the SOURCE rather than from memory: every
// function in the door packages that puts a secret-bearing leaf of a server
// config / contract (or a raw config struct) into a response map, a
// contracts.* literal, or a publish sink. Each one must appear in
// serverPayloadDoors with the rule it uses — or with the reason it needs none.
//
// A new door therefore cannot be added silently: the scan finds it, the
// inventory does not have it, and this test goes red in the same edit. A door
// that is deleted or renamed fails too, so the inventory cannot rot.

// rawServerLeafDoors is the exemption table for the RAW-LEAF scan: every
// function that still puts an unredacted server leaf into a payload shape, and
// the reason that is correct there. A function NOT in this table that the scan
// finds fails the test — that is the check that would have caught rounds 5, 6,
// 7 and 8 in one go.
//
// Nothing here may be a client-facing wire carrying an unredacted credential.
// Each row is either an INTERNAL projection whose only route to a client runs
// through a named shared-rule door, a value that is not operator-supplied, or a
// payload redacted at the return statement of the same function.

// --- round 9: the shapes the round-8 scan was blind to -----------------------
//
// The round-8 scan matched map literals, `contracts.*` literals, map-index
// assignments, and identifiers tainted from an expression whose SOURCE TEXT
// ended in `.Servers`. Round 9 found live doors it could not see, all of them
// one of two shapes:
//
//   - a NAMED STRUCT that embeds or holds a raw config value and is handed to a
//     publish sink (`writeJSON(w, 200, &ServerResponse{...})`), or that copies
//     the leaves out of one (`ImportedServerResponse{URL: imported.Server.URL}`
//     on `POST /api/v1/servers/import`, whose CLI twin round 8 redacted), and
//   - a whole `*config.Config` reaching a publish sink through a call —
//     `contracts.ConvertConfigToContract(cfg)` on `GET /api/v1/config`, which
//     serves every server's env, headers, oauth.client_secret and url
//     credentials plus the global docker_isolation.extra_args in one response.
//
// A guard that cannot see the shape the real defects have is worse than none,
// because it reads as coverage. So the scan no longer judges by source text: it
// indexes the declared TYPES of the scanned trees and derives, at a fixpoint,
// which named types carry a raw `config.Config` / `config.ServerConfig`, which
// expose a secret-bearing leaf field, which actually REACH a publish sink, and
// which functions RETURN a raw config — all from the same source it scans.

// configTypeIndex is that derived index. Every set is keyed by the type's
// PACKAGE-QUALIFIED name (`api.ServerResponse`, `config.ServerConfig`): a bare
// name collides across the tree — a dozen packages declare a `Client` — and a
// collision in a fail-closed scan is noise, which is how an inventory stops
// being kept green.
