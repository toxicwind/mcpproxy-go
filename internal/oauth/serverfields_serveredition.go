// editionServerFieldMaskDecisions records the write-path answer for the
// server-edition-only `auth_broker` block (config.AuthBrokerConfig).
//
// Every leaf is REFUSED. The block is replaced wholesale by a write and nothing
// binds a mask back into it, so an echo of a read mask must be rejected rather
// than persisted over the brokered credential — the same answer `args` and
// `oauth.scopes` get, and the same reason. The `header` / `header_format`
// leaves left with the never-wired injector (Spec 107 FR-032).
