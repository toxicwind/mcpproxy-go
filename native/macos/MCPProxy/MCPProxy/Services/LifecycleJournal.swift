// LifecycleJournal.swift
// MCPProxy
//
// A persistent record of who started and stopped what (GH #862).
//
// The gap it fills: when the app and its core disappeared mid-session, nothing
// on disk said why. Graceful paths log — but only to the running process's log,
// and only while it is running; a SIGKILL-class death (jetsam, `pkill`, a crash
// outside our handlers) leaves the log simply STOPPING, which reads exactly like
// a clean quit once the process is gone. macOS purges the Info/Debug tier of the
// unified log within hours, so by the time anyone looks there is nothing left to
// read either.
//
// Two things follow from that, and they are the whole design:
//
//   * Every ending records a REASON, at the moment it happens. A shutdown that
//     logs nothing is indistinguishable from a kill.
//   * A run that recorded no ending is detectable at the NEXT launch. That is
//     the only way a silent death is ever attributable, because the process that
//     could have described it is gone.
//
// The file is JSON lines rather than a JSON document precisely because it is
// written by a process that may be killed mid-write: a truncated tail costs the
// last record, not the file. Everything here is best-effort — diagnostics must
// never be why the app fails to start.
