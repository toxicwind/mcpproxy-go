// UpdatePolicy.swift
// MCPProxy
//
// Spec 092 FR-015 — the update policy, as an explicit contract.
//
// Three parties get a vote on whether the tray may check for updates:
//
//   1. the core, over `GET /api/v1/info` → `update_policy` (config
//      `update_check.enabled` / `channel`, plus the core's own environment
//      overrides, already resolved for us);
//   2. the tray's OWN environment — a user who exports
//      MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE expects the menu-bar app to obey it too,
//      and the tray can (and does) run with no core attached at all;
//   3. the context — CI / non-interactive, where a nudge has no one to read it.
//
// Resolving them is a pure function so the precedence is testable without a
// Sparkle framework, a core, or a menu. The one rule that is NOT expressed here
// is the one FR-015 states last: a user-initiated "Check for Updates" is always
// allowed. That is enforced at the call site (`UpdateService.checkForUpdates`),
// because the policy has nothing to say about an action the user just took.
