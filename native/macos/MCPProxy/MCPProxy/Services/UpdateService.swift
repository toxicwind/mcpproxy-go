// Spec 092 Phase 1 (FR-010 / FR-015 / FR-016 / FR-017) — the single owner of
// everything the tray knows about updates.
//
// Two update brains exist and both are legitimate:
//
//   · the FEED (Sparkle appcast) — can download, verify and install; the only
//     one that can deliver FR-010's one click;
//   · the LEGACY check (the core's `/api/v1/info` + a direct GitHub call) —
//     always reachable, but can only open a browser.
//
// Before Phase 1 they were rendered independently by the menu, which is what
// FR-017 forbids. This service now resolves them into ONE ordered list of menu
// entries (`UpdateMenuState`), gates every unattended check on the effective
// policy (`UpdatePolicyResolver`), and stops the managed core before Sparkle
// replaces the bundle (`ManagedCoreStop`).
