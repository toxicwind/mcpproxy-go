import AppKit

/// A coloured badge dot drawn over the status item's template icon.
///
/// Why a subview and not pixels in `button.image`: an `NSStatusItem` image must
/// stay `isTemplate` so AppKit re-tints it for light/dark menu bars and inverts
/// it while the menu is open. Template rendering forces every pixel to the
/// menu-bar's own colour, so a red dot composited into the image comes back
/// black. A sibling view is drawn after the template pass and keeps its colour
/// in all three appearances.
///
/// Why the view fills the WHOLE button rather than being a 6x6 view positioned
/// at the corner: the dot is anchored to the centred 18pt ICON, not to the
/// button, and the button's width changes (it is `variableLength`, and the
/// core-state glyph comes and goes from `attributedTitle`). A small subview
/// pinned into the button's corner breaks three ways —
///
///  * **`NSStatusBarButton` is FLIPPED.** `NSButton.isFlipped` is `true` (unlike
///    a plain `NSView`), so inside the button y grows DOWNWARD: a frame at
///    `y = 2` is 2pt from the TOP, and `.maxYMargin` pins to the TOP. The first
///    attempt at this badge did exactly that and shipped the dot in the icon's
///    top-right corner while every test passed, because no test rendered it
///    inside a real status button. This is the trap; it is the reason the whole
///    design now lives in `draw(_:)` of an UNFLIPPED view.
///  * `[.minXMargin, …]` pins horizontally to the BUTTON's edge, so when the
///    button shrinks by N the dot moves left by N while the centred icon's
///    right edge moves left by only N/2.
///  * `NSStatusItem` resizes asynchronously, so `button.bounds` read straight
///    after clearing `attributedTitle` is still the old, wider value — the dot
///    is laid out against an icon centre that no longer exists.
///
/// Filling the bounds and computing the dot inside `draw(_:)` from the CURRENT
/// bounds removes all three: the geometry is re-derived every draw, in this
/// view's own bottom-left space, independent of the button's.
/// (Cross-model review, gpt-5.6-sol; flipped-coordinate trap found by the
/// verification sweep.)
