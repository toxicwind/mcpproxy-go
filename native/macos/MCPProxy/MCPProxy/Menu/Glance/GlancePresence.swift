// GlancePresence.swift
// MCPProxy
//
// Who has been using the proxy, and how recently — the model behind the tray
// glance "Clients" section. Pure functions over APIClient.MCPSession, no AppKit,
// for the same reason GlanceSelection is: presentation policy this fiddly
// (three boundaries, a dedupe, a cap and a count) has to be testable without a
// menu.
//
// Why presence at all, rather than "connected clients": MCP over HTTP is
// stateless. A session is a server-side record that closes after 30 minutes of
// silence and is only persisted once real work happens, so "currently
// connected" is not a thing the transport can answer. Listing only `active`
// sessions therefore left the section empty most of the day and told the user
// "nothing is connected" about a proxy three clients had used that morning.
// Recency is the honest question, and it has an honest answer.
