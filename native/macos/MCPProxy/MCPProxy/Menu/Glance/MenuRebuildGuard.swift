/// fire during active traffic, i.e. potentially while the user is reading the
/// menu. `removeAllItems()` under the cursor — a menu that grows or shrinks
/// mid-read, or an open submenu that collapses — is exactly the irritation the
/// glance design forbids, so structural churn waits for `menuDidClose`.
///
/// **The invariant that makes this safe: `menuWillOpen` rebuilds the menu
/// unconditionally before every single display.** So the guard governs only what
/// happens *between* an open and a close, and anything it suppresses is
/// re-applied before the user can next see the menu. Nothing this guard drops
/// can survive into a display — which is why suppressing non-glance sections
/// too (they are not consulted at all while open) is a freeze rather than a
/// staleness bug, and why the deferred rebuild on `menuDidClose` is a belt to
/// that brace rather than the only thing standing between the user and stale
/// rows. `updateStatusIcon()` deliberately sits outside the guard, so the tray
/// icon remains a live alert channel even while the menu is frozen.
