// GlanceSection.swift
// MCPProxy
//
// Builds the "glance" block at the top of the tray menu: a one-line summary,
// the inline 24h histogram, the most recent qualifying tool calls, and the
// active MCP clients.
//
// Every text row is a plain NSMenuItem. Custom (view-backed) menu items receive
// mouse events but NOT keyboard events, so building the rows as hosted SwiftUI
// would silently cost keyboard navigation and VoiceOver. Only the histogram —
// which genuinely needs drawing — is view-backed; it renders inline, directly
// under the summary line, so the day's shape is visible the moment the menu
// opens (it used to hide in an "Activity (24h)" submenu, which made the
// overview the only row that required a second navigation step).
//
// Clicking a row (or "Open Activity…") opens the app's native window at the
// Activity section — never a browser. Rows carry a target/action pair into the
// app delegate, plus a representedObject holding the record's session id; the
// id is what the in-place update uses to tell "same run, later clock" from
// "this row now shows a different record" (see `apply(_:to:now:)`).
//
// @MainActor as a type: every member here either builds live NSMenuItems or
// reads AppState, so main-thread-only is the truth about this component, and
// stating it structurally beats relying on rebuildMenu() happening to be the
// sole route in.
//
// That does mean the initializer is main-actor-only too, and AppController (the
// NSApplicationDelegate that owns this, MCPProxyApp.swift:15) is NOT
// actor-isolated — this SDK does not infer MainActor from NSApplicationDelegate
// conformance — so its `private lazy var glance = ...` stored property would
// otherwise fail with "call to main actor-isolated initializer
// 'init(target:action:)' in a synchronous nonisolated context". The fix is one
// @MainActor on that stored property, at the construction site.
//
// Do NOT "simplify" this by marking the initializer `nonisolated` instead. It
// compiles and passes, but assigning the isolated `clickTarget` from a
// nonisolated init warns "main actor-isolated property 'clickTarget' can not be
// mutated from a nonisolated context; this is an error in the Swift 6 language
// mode" — i.e. it buys a glance-local diff today at the cost of a blocker when
// this package moves to Swift 6. clickTarget cannot be a `let` either: it is
// deliberately `weak` (AppController owns the section strongly), and `weak`
// requires `var`.
