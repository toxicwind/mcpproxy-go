// Spec 092 Phase 0, FR-001 / FR-001a / FR-002 / FR-005 / FR-006 — issue #957
// ("old version App still after upgrade").
//
// After an upgrade the new tray frequently finds an OLD core already running:
// the previous tray spawned it, the previous tray is gone, and nothing in the
// system ever stops it. The tray attaches to it and serves the old version
// indefinitely, silently. This file is the decision that ends that.
//
// The decision is a pure function on purpose. Everything it governs is
// destructive — stopping a process the user may be depending on — so the rules
// have to be readable in one place and testable without spawning anything.
// `CoreProcessManager` supplies the inputs and executes the verdict; it makes
// no policy of its own.
