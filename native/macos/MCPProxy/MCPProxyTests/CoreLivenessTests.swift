// GH #926 — "menu bar icon never detects externally managed core stopping".
//
// When the tray ATTACHES to a core it did not spawn, there is no `Process` and
// therefore no `terminationHandler` — which was the only thing in the app that
// ever noticed a dead core. The SSE client retries forever without ever
// finishing its stream, and every periodic refresh swallows its errors, so
// `coreState` could never leave `.connected`: the menu bar icon kept claiming
// the core was healthy indefinitely.
//
// These tests drive the real attach path against a stub core on a Unix socket,
// then take that core away — or, harder and more realistic, leave it listening
// while it stops answering.
