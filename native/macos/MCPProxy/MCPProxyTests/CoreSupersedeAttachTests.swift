// Spec 092 FR-001/FR-002 through the REAL attach path: a core on a Unix socket
// answering `/api/v1/info`, the manager attaching to it, and the supersede
// verdict landing in `AppState` (or not).
//
// The decision table is covered by `CoreSupersedeDecisionTests`. What can only
// be shown here is the wiring: that a version report actually reaches the
// decision, that the prompt is published where the menu reads it, and that a
// verdict which would signal a process refuses to signal one that is not a
// core.
