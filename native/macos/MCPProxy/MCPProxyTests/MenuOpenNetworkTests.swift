/// Spec 048's invariant, driven through the real controller: opening the tray
/// menu performs no network request (spec 090 FR-022 / SC-006).
///
/// Why it needs a seam rather than a stub sitting next to the code: the earlier
/// version of this check constructed a `CountingGlanceDataSource`, never handed
/// it to anything, and asserted it had not been called. It could not fail. The
/// controller's data source is now injectable, and its tray menu can be hosted
/// by something other than a live `NSStatusItem`, so the menu-open sequence runs
/// here exactly as it runs in production — `menuWillOpen` → `rebuildMenu` →
/// (menu open, state changes) → `rebuildMenu` → `updateInPlace` → `menuDidClose`
/// — with every request counted at two levels: the injected data source, and the
/// URL loading system underneath the `APIClient` the controller would otherwise
/// reach for.
