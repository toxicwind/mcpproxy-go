# TPA Scanner: Inline Findings & Background Scanning — Authoritative Design

*All paths relative to the worktree root. Line numbers verified against the working tree on 2026-09-01.*

**Status: Phase 1 IMPLEMENTED (2026-09-01), D1 deferred (see §6a).** Three maintainer decisions were
locked during implementation and are authoritative wherever they differ from the
body of this document:

| | Decision | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | `shadowing.cross_server`'s **reference** branch demote from `TierHard` to `TierSoft` is **APPROVED but DEFERRED** — see §6a. The chosen fix is the demote, **not** a `distinctiveName()` patch; neither is applied yet. Phase 1 ships the **span** only, which is tier-independent. | §3.4, §6a, §7 Risk 1, §8 Q1 |
| **D2** | Per-server `auto_baseline_scan: false` means **no automatic scanning of that server at all** — the admission baseline, the tool-change rescan and the bundle-activation rescan are all suppressed. One switch. | §4.2, §4.3, §8 Q2 (Phase 3) |
| **D3** | Finding suppression is keyed per **(tool, rule, span text)**, so the same rule matching *different* words after a rug-pull re-fires. | §6 Phase 3, §8 Q3 (Phase 3) |

---

## 1. The two pains, and the one-sentence fix for each

**Pain 1 — the finding is a destination, not an annotation.** Reading one finding costs 4 clicks and a 16-page scan-history table, and `finding.location` (`ScanReport.vue:285`, `:391`) is inert `<code>` — repo-wide grep confirms it is never a link.
**Fix:** make `finding.location` a router-link into the server's Tools tab, and render the flagged tools inline where the tools already live (`ServerDetail.vue` Tools tab), using `scanReport.value.findings[]` which is **already in memory on every tab** (`loadScanReport()` runs unconditionally in `onMounted`, `ServerDetail.vue:3785-3787`).

**Pain 2 — the finding names a tool but never the words.** `Evidence` for the reported rule is a *fabricated sentence*, not a quote: `shadowing.go:216` emits `fmt.Sprintf("description references cross-server tool %q", tok)`. There is no offset field anywhere on `Signal` (`signal.go:39-46`), `detect.Finding`, or `ScanFinding`.
**Fix:** add a `Span` (offsets + escaped snippet checksum) to the signal→finding→ScanFinding chain, populated from the offsets the raw-text checks *already compute and throw away* — `tpa_bundle.go:155` literally has `loc := r.re.FindStringIndex(tool.Description)` in hand.

**Grounding case, and why highlighting is the product argument:** the reported finding is a **false positive**. `distinctiveName()` (`shadowing.go:48-59`) accepts any lowercase token ≥6 chars not in a 29-entry `commonNames` map; `"reason"` is exactly 6 and absent from it; `perplexity` exposes a tool named `reason`; `create_user`'s 4,500-char description contains *"For this reason, you can't add two IAM users…"*. A highlight turns a ten-minute investigation into a one-second dismissal.

## 2. Information architecture

Only surfaces that actually change.

| Surface (file:line) | What's added | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/src/views/ScanReport.vue:283-286`, `:389-392` | `finding.location` → `<router-link :to="toolTarget(...)">`; falls back to `<code>` when the location is not `server:tool` | Closes the report→evidence loop in ~8 lines. Other scanners emit file paths and `tool:`+name (`engine.go:1014`), so the parse must be total. |
| `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue:424` (above the quarantine banner) | New `<FlaggedToolsPanel>` — one row per flagged tool: threat chip · rule id · one-line detail · **Show in description** | The flagged list belongs where the tools are. Needs **zero** new backend: `scanReport.value` (ref at `:1680`) is loaded on every tab. |
| `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue:727-729` (Available Tools card) | Bare `{{ tool.description }}` → `<ToolDescription>` (highlighted) | The one surface that already renders the full, untruncated flagged description with nothing marking it. |
| `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue:687-699` (badge row) | `<FindingChip>` beside `new` / `changed` / `🔒 locked by config` | Same slot pattern `HoldEvidenceBadge` uses at `:528-533`. |
| `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue:1446-1497` (Security tab) | Counts-only `1 dangerous` → the same `<FlaggedToolsPanel>`; `View Full Report →` stays | The tab whose entire job is security currently refuses to name which of 15 tools is the problem. |
| `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue:854-889` (Configuration tab) | Per-server "Scan this server's tool descriptions" toggle under the trust-mode selector | Phase 3. Per-server opt-out does not exist today. |
| `frontend/src/views/Tools.vue:341-345` | New narrow **Scan** column rendering `<FindingChip>` — chip only, **no highlight** | Phase 2. The Description cell is `max-w-xs truncate` single-line (`:336`); a highlight landing in the clipped half is a false negative. |
| `frontend/src/views/Tools.vue:458-461` (detail modal) | `<ToolDescription>` + findings list | Phase 2. Full text renders here; lazily fetch the report on modal open. |
| `frontend/src/views/Tools.vue:139-145` (filters) | `Findings: All / Flagged / Dangerous / Not scanned`, bound to `?finding=` | Phase 2. Mirrors the existing `?q=` handling at `:1039-1060`. |
| `frontend/src/views/settings/fields.ts` `SECURITY_FIELDS` | `security.auto_baseline_scan` toggle, above the existing `deep_scan.enabled` entry | Phase 3. Repo-wide grep for `auto_baseline_scan` under `frontend/src` returns zero hits today. |
| `frontend/src/components/SidebarNav.vue:319-323` | Label `Security Scanners` → **`Security`** | The page `<h1>` already says Security. |

**Explicitly not changing:** no new route, no sidebar count badge, no Dashboard alert, no toast. See §7.

## 3. The highlighting mechanic

### 3.1 Do offsets exist today? Partly — they are computed and discarded.

| Check | What it matches today | Offsets available? |
|---|---|---|
| `tpa.bundle.*` (`scanner/tpa_bundle.go:155`) | `loc := r.re.FindStringIndex(tool.Description)` | **Yes — already computed**, discarded at `:169` |
| `shadowing.cross_server` (`checks/shadowing.go:176`) | `wordRe.FindAllString(tool.Description, -1)` | **Yes — one-token change** to `FindAllStringIndex` |
| `shadowing.clone` (`checks/shadowing.go:76`) | raw description token | Yes |
| `unicode.hidden` (`checks/unicode_hidden.go:41`) | `raw := Description + schemas`, `for i, r := range raw` | Yes, needs field attribution |
| `payload.decoded` (`checks/payload_decoded.go:44,55`) | `base64Re.FindAllString(text, -1)` on raw | Yes, → `FindAllStringIndex` |
| `directive.imperative` (`checks/directive_imperative.go:130`) | `tool.NormalizedText` | **No** — needs `NormalizeWithSpans` (Phase 3) |
| `phrase.injection` (`checks/phrase_injection.go:150`) | `tool.NormalizedText` | **No** — same |

`detect.Normalize` (`normalize.go:37,81`) is NFKC + Cf-strip + lowercase + contraction-expand + collapse + **stem** — lossy and non-invertible as written. It is, however, token-structured, so a raw-range-carrying variant is mechanical bookkeeping, not inference. **Decision:** those two checks get no span in Phases 1–2 and a proven token map in Phase 3 — the refactor deserves a fuzz parity gate, not a UI deadline.

### 3.2 Backend contract — exact fields to add

New file `internal/security/detect/span.go`:

```go
package detect

type SpanField string

const (
	SpanFieldDescription  SpanField = "description"
	SpanFieldInputSchema  SpanField = "input_schema"
	SpanFieldOutputSchema SpanField = "output_schema"
)

// MaxSpansPerFinding bounds the payload for pathological descriptions.
const MaxSpansPerFinding = 32

// Span locates one check's match inside one RAW (un-normalized) tool text field.
//
// Start/End are half-open [Start, End) offsets in UTF-16 CODE UNITS — i.e.
// JavaScript string indices — because the only consumer that renders them is the
// Web UI, where description.slice(start, end) is then exactly correct including
// surrogate pairs. Producers convert byte offsets with UTF16Offsets.
//
// Snippet is CapSpanSnippet(raw[byteStart:byteEnd]): render-SAFE (control and Cf
// runes escaped to literal \uXXXX, capped at MaxEvidenceLen). It is NOT the
// render source — the UI renders the tool's own LIVE description sliced by the
// offsets. Snippet exists solely as the staleness checksum, and it is escaped for
// the reason tpa_bundle.go already documents: a dot-all bundle regex can match
// bidi/zero-width runes from an attacker-controlled description, and the raw span
// must never land verbatim in a JSON payload.
//
// Truncated says the snippet stopped short. It is a declared field, never an
// inference from the snippet's last character. See "the checksum has to
// determine its input" below.
type Span struct {
	Field     SpanField `json:"field"`
	Start     int       `json:"start"`
	End       int       `json:"end"`
	CheckID   string    `json:"check_id"`
	Tier      string    `json:"tier"` // "hard" | "soft" — per-span severity
	Snippet   string    `json:"snippet,omitempty"`
	Truncated bool      `json:"truncated,omitempty"`
}

// UTF16Offsets converts a byte range in s to UTF-16 code-unit offsets.
func UTF16Offsets(s string, byteStart, byteEnd int) (start, end int, ok bool)
```

Threaded additively through three structs:

```go
// internal/security/detect/signal.go — Signal (currently signal.go:39-46, no offsets)
Spans []Span // raw-text locations; empty when the check matched normalized text

// internal/security/detect/aggregate.go — Finding
Spans []Span

// internal/security/scanner/types.go — ScanFinding
Spans []detect.Span `json:"spans,omitempty"`
```

**`aggregate()` must union spans across every signal, not just `primary`.** Today `Evidence`/`Description` come from `primary` alone (`aggregate.go:99-114`) and `aggregate` emits exactly one `Finding` per tool. Primary-wins is tolerable for prose and fatal for highlighting: one description tripping both `tpa.bundle` and `shadowing.cross_server` would highlight one and silently swallow the other. Union, dedupe on `(Field,Start,End,CheckID)` in first-seen order, sort, cap at `MaxSpansPerFinding`. `Span.CheckID`/`Tier` are what let the frontend label a mark correctly despite the single finding-level `rule_id`.

`detectFindingToScanFinding` (`inprocess.go:274-299`) gains one line: `Spans: f.Spans`.

**Field attribution.** `unicode_hidden.go` and `payload_decoded.go` match over a concatenated buffer. Compute the two boundary indices before matching, attribute each hit to the field it falls in, subtract that field's origin, and **drop any span straddling a boundary** rather than emitting a wrong one.

### 3.3 API shape

Phase 1 needs **no new endpoint and no contract change**. `GET /api/v1/servers/{id}/scan/report` already returns `data.findings[]`, and `ServerDetail.vue` already holds it. Spans simply appear on each finding:

```jsonc
{
  "rule_id": "detect.shadowing.cross_server",
  "threat_level": "dangerous",
  "location": "com.googleapis.sqladmin/mcp:create_user",
  "evidence": "description references cross-server tool \"reason\"",
  "signals": ["shadowing.cross_server"],
  "tier": "hard",
  "spans": [
    { "field": "description", "start": 1893, "end": 1899,
      "check_id": "shadowing.cross_server", "tier": "hard", "snippet": "reason" }
    // "truncated": true would appear only when the snippet stopped short of the
    // matched text; it is omitted, not false, in the common case.
  ]
}
```

**Join key** is `Location`, built at `aggregate.go:108` as `fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", tool.Server, tool.Name)` — byte-identical to `storage.ToolApprovalKey` (`models.go:381-383`). **Split on the LAST colon**: server names legitimately contain `/` and `.` (`com.googleapis.sqladmin/mcp`). This lives in one tested pure util, `frontend/src/utils/toolLocation.ts`.

Phase 2 (global Tools list) adds `contracts.Tool.Scan *ToolScanSummary` populated in `enrichServerTools` (`internal/httpapi/server.go:3455`, right beside the `HeldReason/HeldVerdict/HeldSignals` block at `:3473-3475`, which both tools endpoints share). It is backed by an index populated **on the write path** at report-save time, keyed by `Location`; a miss returns `nil` (no badge). It is *not* lazily rebuilt from `GetScanReport` — that call does two full `bucket.ForEach` walks including `SarifRaw` deserialization (`storage/scanner.go:139-158`, `:349`), which would turn one HTTP request into 28 full-bucket scans.

### 3.4 Vue render — text nodes only, verify or degrade

Two pure modules, unit-tested standalone (house pattern: `views/security/deepScanState.ts`, `utils/toolDiff.ts`).

`frontend/src/utils/spanSnippet.ts` — a ~20-line TS mirror of `detect.CapSpanSnippet` (`span.go`), used only for verification. It deliberately does **not** mirror `detect.CapEvidence`: that function stays as it is on the Go side, where it feeds human-read report evidence, and shipping a second near-identical escaper one autocomplete away from the verification path is how the collision below gets reopened.

`frontend/src/utils/highlightSpans.ts`:

```ts
export interface Segment { text: string; sources: SpanSource[]; level: 'dangerous'|'warning'|null }

/** Boundary sweep. Every char of `text` appears in exactly one segment, in order:
 *  segments.map(s => s.text).join('') === text   (asserted by unit test). */
export function segmentByFindings(text: string, sources: SpanSource[]): Segment[]

export function isSpanUsable(text: string, span: FindingSpan): boolean {
  if (span.field !== 'description') return false
  if (span.start < 0 || span.end > text.length || span.start >= span.end) return false
  if (!span.snippet) return true
  // Escape BOTH sides, then compare exactly — as a prefix only when the backend
  // DECLARED it truncated. Never sniff the snippet for a marker.
  const { snippet: actual } = capSpanSnippet(text.slice(span.start, span.end))
  return span.truncated ? actual.startsWith(span.snippet) : actual === span.snippet
}
```

Sweep, not interval nesting: collect all starts/ends into a sorted unique boundary set, emit one segment per interval carrying every covering span. Overlaps become one segment with two `sources` — no nested DOM, no lost or invented text.

**Snippet truncation must clamp the SPAN, not just the checksum.** `CapEvidence` caps at 200 runes, and the bundle's dot-all rules routinely match far more, so a prefix-only comparison verified the first 200 characters of a span and said nothing about the rest — edit only the tail of such a description after the scan and the span still "verifies", drawing a `dangerous` mark across prose no rule ever matched. `detect.DescriptionSpan` therefore clamps `End` to the byte extent `CapSpanSnippet` actually covers, so a mark can never extend past verified text.

**The checksum has to determine its input.** *(Cross-review round 1; both cases were reproduced before being fixed.)* `Snippet` is the only thing standing between a stale span and a confident `dangerous` mark on innocent prose, so two different texts must never produce the same snippet, and a snippet must never be *interpreted*. As first shipped it failed both.

*It was not injective.* `CapEvidence` escapes a control or Cf rune to a six-character `\uXXXX` form but leaves a backslash the description already contained alone, so an escaped rune and the literal characters spelling that escape encode identically. A real newline followed by the six literal characters `\u000b`, and the six literal characters `\u000a` followed by a real vertical tab, are different texts of the same UTF-16 length that both encode to `\u000a\u000b`. Change a description from one to the other after a scan and the span verifies at the same offsets against words no rule matched.

*The truncation marker was sniffed, not declared.* A snippet ending in `…` was treated as a prefix. But `CapEvidence` only appends one past 200 runes, and an ordinary tool description can end a matched passage with an ellipsis of its own: `read the docs…` is 14 runes, untruncated, and ends in the marker. Every later description sharing the prefix `read the docs` then verified.

**Both are fixed at the source rather than in the comparison**, because a comparison patched to work around an ambiguous value stays one edit away from the next collision:

* `detect.CapSpanSnippet` replaces `CapEvidence` **for `Span.Snippet` only**. It doubles a literal backslash and uses a *fixed* width per plane (`\uXXXX` below U+10000, `\UXXXXXXXX` above), which makes the per-rune encoding prefix-free and therefore the whole encoding injective — no argument about which code points happen to be escapable, a set that grows with each Unicode revision. `CapEvidence` itself is untouched: it feeds user-facing evidence throughout `detect`, its exact output is pinned by existing tests, and changing it is a far larger blast radius than this needs.
* `Span.Truncated bool` carries truncation explicitly; the snippet holds no marker at all. The frontend prefix-compares **only** when the flag is set.
* Verification stays **synchronous**. A digest (`crypto.subtle`) would make the render path async and buys nothing once the escaping is injective.
* The Go and TS halves are a mirror pair, pinned by one vector list asserted on both sides (`TestCapSpanSnippetParityVectors` / `span-snippet.spec.ts`), including both collision cases above.

**Structurally impossible spans are dropped at the union.** `unionSpans` forwarded whatever a signal handed it, so a hand-built `Span` literal with an inverted range or an unknown field would have reached the payload; the frontend drops it, so this was latent, not live — `DescriptionSpan` is the only span constructor in the tree and it refuses to build one. The backstop lives at the union anyway, because that is the single seam every span crosses on its way into JSON and `Span` is an exported struct that a future check in a sibling package can fill in by hand. It judges structure only: the tool text is long gone by then, so bounds remain `DescriptionSpan`'s job.

**Excerpt windows are surrogate-safe.** `start - EXCERPT_CONTEXT_CHARS` is arithmetic that knows nothing about code points and can land between the halves of an astral character; the edges are snapped outward before slicing (`snapOffSurrogate`), or the excerpt opens with a lone surrogate the browser paints as U+FFFD. The mirror-image worry — two adjacent unmarked segments snapping *towards* each other across one pair and each emitting the same emoji — was raised in cross-review and does not occur, for two independent reasons now pinned by tests: the sweep cannot produce two adjacent unmarked segments at all (every interior boundary is some span's start or end, and so covers one side), and a clip landing exactly on a segment's own boundary is left unsnapped.

**No `indexOf` fallback.** A 6-char token appearing four times in a 4,500-char description makes it a coin flip that confidently marks innocuous prose. Verify, or degrade honestly.

`frontend/src/components/ToolDescription.vue`:

```vue
<p class="text-sm text-base-content/70 mt-2 whitespace-pre-wrap">
  <template v-for="(seg, i) in segments" :key="i">
    <span v-if="!seg.level">{{ seg.text }}</span>
    <mark
      v-else
      class="bg-transparent text-inherit px-0.5 rounded-sm underline underline-offset-4 decoration-2"
      :class="markClass(seg.level)"
    >
      <!-- IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT tabindex / role="button" / aria-label /
           aria-describedby / the three handlers this sketch showed. Phase 1
           ships no findings list for a mark to move focus TO, so role="button"
           plus "Activate to show the finding" was a tab stop that lied, and
           @keydown.space.prevent swallowed page scrolling in exchange for
           nothing. role="button" is also Children Presentational in ARIA, so
           the aria-label REPLACED the flagged words and truncated them at 60
           characters — hiding the back half of a long payload from the only
           readers who cannot see it on screen. The severity/rule prefix is a
           .sr-only span instead, leaving the flagged text itself as the
           accessible content. Wire the affordance back on in the phase that
           actually ships the target. -->
      <template v-for="(p, j) in revealInvisibles(seg.text)" :key="j">
        <code v-if="p.hidden" class="badge badge-xs badge-error font-mono align-baseline"
              :aria-label="`${p.name}, U+${p.hex}`">U+{{ p.hex }}</code>
        <template v-else>{{ p.text }}</template>
      </template>
      <sup class="ml-0.5 text-[10px] font-bold">{{ seg.sources[0].index }}</sup>
    </mark>
  </template>
</p>
```

Every upstream character reaches the DOM through `{{ }}`. **No `v-html` on any path.** The guard is a **test**, `frontend/tests/unit/tool-description-no-v-html.spec.ts`, not an ESLint override: `npm run lint` in this repo is a literal `echo` no-op and `eslint.config.cjs` is an eslintrc-shaped file while the installed ESLint is v10, which reads only flat config — `npx eslint src/components/ToolDescription.vue` answers "File ignored because no matching configuration was supplied" and exits 0. A rule added there would read like a guarantee and enforce nothing. `revealInvisibles()` turns zero-width/bidi runes into visible chips — otherwise a `unicode.hidden` highlight has nothing to draw. `<mark>`'s UA default is a hard yellow that is illegible on the dark DaisyUI theme, hence the explicit `bg-transparent text-inherit` reset before the tint.

**Density policy — both tiers get a mark.** As drafted: only `tier === "hard"` spans get an inline `<mark>`; soft spans get a paragraph rule instead. That policy is self-defeating either way. Today both span producers are hard (`tpa.bundle.*` and, until D1 lands, `shadowing.cross_server`), so a hard-only rule is a no-op; once D1 lands it would render *zero* marks for the "For this reason," false positive that is this document's own grounding case. **Implemented: soft spans get an inline mark too**, distinguished by tone, glyph and decoration (`▮` + `decoration-wavy decoration-warning` vs `▲` + `decoration-double decoration-error`), never by colour alone. Cap at 20 verified **spans** per description, then "+N more matches" — note this bounds spans, not `<mark>` elements: the boundary sweep splits overlaps, so N spans render as up to 2N-1 marks. Capping marks instead would mean dropping part of a span mid-word. Descriptions over 1,200 chars render a windowed excerpt around each marked span (±200 chars) with a "show full description" toggle — never truncating *through* a mark.

Severity is encoded three ways, never colour alone: `▲ dangerous` / `decoration-double decoration-error`, `▮ warning` / `decoration-wavy decoration-warning`. DaisyUI semantic tokens only, never raw Tailwind colours.

### 3.5 Fallback ladder

| Case | Render |
|---|---|
| Spans present, all usable | Highlighted text + findings list |
| Spans present, **all** fail `isSpanUsable` | Plain description + findings list + `⟳ Description changed since the last scan — highlights hidden.` |
| Spans present, **some** fail `isSpanUsable` | The verified marks + `⟳ Description changed since the last scan — N flagged passages could not be located.` Partial staleness must be counted and announced, or a description that changed since the scan renders as confidently and completely annotated while a finding silently vanishes. |
| Spans absent (normalized-text check, or a Docker/SARIF scanner) | Plain description + findings list; the finding row reads `Location: whole description` and shows **no** "Show in description" button |
| No scan for this tool | Nothing. No badge, no "not scanned" nag on the card |

Governing rule: **the description text never disappears behind a scan state.** Every failure mode degrades to today's rendering, which is strictly not worse.

## 4. Background scanning policy

### 4.1 What already ships — do not rebuild it

`security.auto_baseline_scan` (`config.go:2939`, resolver `IsAutoBaselineScanEnabled()` at `:3005`, nil ⇒ **true**, env kill-switch `MCPPROXY_AUTO_BASELINE_SCAN` at `:2021`) already drives `internal/server/scan_informational.go`: an informational baseline scan on every newly admitted server in **any** trust mode, plus a one-shot per-installation sweep. On-by-default was won in #1031. Missing: **recurrence** (`claimInformationalScan` refuses any server whose `GetScanSummary != nil` — a server is auto-scanned exactly once, ever), **per-server opt-out**, and **any UI**.

### 4.2 Trigger matrix

| Event | Scan type | Cost | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server admitted / first enabled | full `StartScan`, baseline only | up to ~60s if disconnected | **exists**, unchanged |
| One-shot post-upgrade sweep | full `StartScan`, serialized, 45s delay | bounded, once per install | **exists**, unchanged |
| **Tool-set change (all trust modes)** | `StartScan`, **Ready-only** | ~2.9s observed for 15 tools | **NEW (Phase 3)** |
| **Signature-bundle fingerprint change** | in-process pass over cached metadata | one pass, no connections | **NEW (Phase 3)** |
| Manual "Scan Now" / REST / CLI / MCP | unchanged | — | exists |
| Daily / periodic timer | — | — | **REJECTED** |

**Why no daily timer:** nothing between a tool-set change and a bundle change can alter a verdict, so a ticker buys zero findings at maximum churn — and `EnsureConnected` inside `StartScan` **restarts stdio servers** (`service.go:1108-1115`) and can burn ~60s per server (`scan_informational.go:46-57`). The two event triggers strictly dominate it.

**D2 — per-server opt-out is one switch.** `auto_baseline_scan: false` on a server suppresses **every** automatic scan of it: the admission baseline, the tool-change rescan and the bundle-activation rescan alike. It does not touch manual "Scan Now" / REST / CLI / MCP scans, which are an operator action, not automation.

**Hard precondition on the new triggers:** *never call `EnsureConnected` from a rescan path.* Enqueue only when the server is already `Ready`; otherwise drop the request and mark the verdict stale. Without this, a reconnect storm becomes self-amplifying (reconnect → tool churn → rescan → restart → reconnect).

**Why the bundle trigger gates on fingerprint, not on `ConfigureBundle`:** `ConfigureBundle` (`service.go:293`) runs on *every* config hot-reload; gate on a change in `BundleInfo.Fingerprint` or a config save fans out to 28 servers.

**Concurrency & rate limits (28 servers):** 60s per-server debounce · 10-minute per-server minimum interval, any reason · globally serialized behind the existing `infoScanRunMu` (one background scan proxy-wide) · baseline `tpa-descriptions` only (`InProcess: true`, `NetworkReq: false`, `registry_bundled.go:140-156`). Deep scan is never reachable from any background path.

**Provenance ships in the same PR as the new triggers, not after.** `scan_informational.go:99-118` documents a HIGH-severity window where a clean informational settle can auto-unquarantine a `trust_mode:"scan"` server via `maybeAutoApproveScanSettled` (`server.go:661`); broadening triggers widens it. Add `ScanJob.Origin string` (`admission|informational|tool_change|bundle_activation|manual`), carry `job_id` + `origin` on `publishScanSettled` (`event_bus.go:764-775`), and make `maybeAutoApproveScanSettled` accept **only** `origin == "admission"`.

### 4.3 Config keys

```jsonc
{
  "security": {
    "auto_baseline_scan": true        // EXISTS: *bool, nil ⇒ true, env MCPPROXY_AUTO_BASELINE_SCAN
  },
  "mcpServers": [
    { "name": "internal-tools", "trust_mode": "auto", "auto_baseline_scan": false }  // NEW
  ]
}
```

Per-server field on `ServerConfig` (`config.go`, beside `TrustMode` at `:611`), reusing the global key's name and the `AutoApproveToolChanges` tri-state pointer convention:

```go
// AutoBaselineScan overrides security.auto_baseline_scan for this server.
// nil (default) inherits the global value. Orthogonal to TrustMode, which
// governs APPROVAL gating, not scanning.
//
// false means NO AUTOMATIC SCANNING OF THIS SERVER AT ALL (D2): the admission
// baseline, the tool-change rescan and the bundle-activation rescan are all
// suppressed. Manual scans are unaffected.
AutoBaselineScan *bool `json:"auto_baseline_scan,omitempty" mapstructure:"auto-baseline-scan"`
```

Six wiring points, all mandatory (spec 086 FR-017 had to add exactly this set for `TrustMode`): `DetectConfigChanges`/`slices.Equal` · `MergeServerConfig` (`merge.go:159`) · `CopyServerConfig` (`merge.go:591`) · `make swagger` (`Makefile:41`; `make swagger-verify` is the CI gate) · no per-server env override · `docs/features/security-quarantine.md`.

### 4.4 Opt-out UI

- **Global:** `frontend/src/views/settings/fields.ts` `SECURITY_FIELDS`, above `security.deep_scan.enabled`. Toggle, with a `danger.confirmValue: false` confirmation ("new and changed tool descriptions are never scanned for poisoning"). The `security` block is deep-compared and hot-reloads — **no `restart: true`**.
- **Per-server:** `ServerDetail.vue` Configuration tab, directly under the trust-mode block (`:854-889`), `data-test="server-auto-scan"`, rendering "Following the global setting (on)" when the value is `null` — the same tri-state presentation `TrustModeSelector.vue` uses.

### 4.5 Progress and failure — no nagging

**No toasts, no modals, no banners, no tray badge for any background scan result.** Running → the existing chip slot shows `loading loading-xs`, driven through `decideScanReconcile()` (`utils/scanState.ts:65`), never re-derived — that reducer is what fixed the stuck-"Scanning…" bug MCP-2740. Failed → a neutral `Scan could not complete` chip in the `precaution` tone, reusing the `HOLD_REASON_SCAN_COVERAGE` vocabulary (`utils/holdEvidence.ts:201`); a coverage failure is not a threat verdict and must never render red. New finding while the operator is on the page → the row appears; nothing steals focus.

## 5. States

| Surface | Empty | Scanning | Stale | Failed | Clean | Flagged |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FlaggedToolsPanel` | not rendered at all — absence *is* the clean state | 3 skeleton rows | banner `Some findings predate the current tool descriptions. [Rescan]` | `Could not load scan findings. [Retry]`, header kept | not rendered | one `<details>` row per tool: chip · rule id · detail · **Show in description** |
| `ToolDescription` | plain `<p>`, byte-identical to today | plain (never a skeleton over readable text) | plain + `⟳ Description changed since the last scan — highlights hidden. [Rescan]` | plain + small `⚠ findings unavailable` note | plain | highlighted + findings list |
| `FindingChip` (card / row) | absent | `loading-xs` | chip + `⟳` with `title` | neutral `Scan could not complete` | absent | `▲ dangerous` / `▮ warning` |
| Tools **Scan** column | `—`, `title="Not scanned yet"` | `skeleton h-4 w-12` | chip + `⟳` | `—` (a scan failure must never hide a tool) | `—` | chip |
| Tools `?finding=flagged` | `No flagged tools.` + link to `/security` | skeleton rows | — | existing table error panel | same as empty | filtered rows |
| ServerDetail Security tab | existing "no findings" copy | existing progress card (`:1293-1327`) | `Scanned <rel>; N tools changed since.` | existing scan-failed banner | counts + `View Full Report →` | `FlaggedToolsPanel` + report link |
| ScanReport location link | plain `<code>` for non-`server:tool` | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | `router-link` |
| Per-server scan toggle | n/a | disabled + spinner during `PUT` | n/a | revert optimistic state + inline error | n/a | n/a |

Two invariants: **an unscanned tool is never styled as a safe tool**, and **a failed scan is never styled as a threat**.

## 6. Phase plan

### Phase 1 — one click from finding to highlighted word — **IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-01** *(no storage, no contracts, no codegen, no swagger)*

**Backend**
- `internal/security/detect/span.go` **(new)** — `Span`, `SpanField*`, `MaxSpansPerFinding`, `UTF16Offsets`.
- `internal/security/detect/signal.go` — `Signal.Spans []Span`.
- `internal/security/detect/aggregate.go:103-114` — `Finding.Spans`; union across **all** signals, dedupe, sort, cap.
- `internal/security/detect/checks/shadowing.go:176` — `FindAllString` → `FindAllStringIndex`, emit spans in both the reference branch (`:216`) and the clone branch (`:76`).
- `internal/security/scanner/tpa_bundle.go:155-169` — emit a span from the `loc` it already computes.
- `internal/security/scanner/types.go` — `ScanFinding.Spans []detect.Span \`json:"spans,omitempty"\``.
- `internal/security/scanner/inprocess.go:274-299` — carry `Spans`.
- **D1 is NOT in this PR — deferred, see §6a.** `shadowing.go` still emits `TierHard`/0.85 on both branches. What ships is the reference branch's **span**, which is tier-independent. The eval corpus, `cmd/scan-eval/gate.go` and the three feature docs are **untouched**; the gate passes at `recall=1.0000` against the unmodified corpus.
  - **Not migrated:** `ScanFinding.Tier` is persisted, and nothing rescans an already-scanned server on upgrade, so an install that already hit this false positive keeps its stored `tier:"hard"` / `threat_level:"dangerous"` report until it rescans manually. There is no ruleset-version invalidation mechanism in the tree today; adding one belongs with the Phase 3 rescan triggers (§4.2), where a bundle-fingerprint change already has to invalidate stale reports.

**API changed fields:** `ScanFinding.spans[]` on the existing `GET /servers/{id}/scan/report` and `GET /security/scans/{jobId}/report`. Nothing else.

**Frontend**
- `frontend/src/utils/spanSnippet.ts`, `frontend/src/utils/highlightSpans.ts`, `frontend/src/utils/toolLocation.ts` **(new)**.
- `frontend/src/components/ToolDescription.vue`, `FindingChip.vue`, `FlaggedToolsPanel.vue` **(new)**.
- `frontend/src/views/ServerDetail.vue` — mount panel at `:424`; `<ToolDescription>` at `:727-729`; `<FindingChip>` at `:687-699`; group `scanReport.value.findings` by `location`; honour `?tool=` deep link near `:3785`.
- `frontend/src/views/ScanReport.vue:283-286`, `:389-392` — location → `router-link`.
- `frontend/src/components/SidebarNav.vue:319-323` — label rename only.

**Tests**
Go: `internal/security/detect/span_test.go` (UTF-16 conversion incl. surrogate pairs; out-of-range rejection) · `internal/security/detect/checks/shadowing_span_test.go` (**the `"For this reason,"` fixture — assert the span lands exactly on `reason` when the token is distinctive, and that `reason` no longer fires after the precision fix**) · `internal/security/scanner/tpa_bundle_span_test.go` · `internal/security/detect/aggregate_span_test.go` (union / dedupe / cap).
Frontend, all at `frontend/tests/unit/*.spec.ts` (`src/**/__tests__/*` never runs — `vitest.config.ts:10`): `highlight-spans.spec.ts` (**round-trip `segments.map(s=>s.text).join('') === text`**; overlap → one segment, two sources; clamping) · `cap-evidence.spec.ts` (vectors copied from the Go test) · `tool-description-highlight.spec.ts` (a description containing `<img src=x onerror=1>` produces no markup; mark count and order) · `tool-location.spec.ts` (last-colon split; `com.googleapis.sqladmin/mcp:create_user`; non-tool locations → `null`) · `flagged-tools-panel.spec.ts` · `scan-report-location-link.spec.ts`.
Plus the Playwright sweep required whenever `frontend/src/` is touched (`docs/development/web-ui-verification.md`).

### 6a. Why D1 (the demote) is deferred — decided 2026-09-01

The demote is approved. It is held back until scan reports carry a **ruleset version**, for one reason: **a tier change only reaches an install on rescan.** `ThreatLevel` and `tier` are persisted as data on the stored report, and nothing in the tree invalidates a report when the ruleset that produced it changes. Shipping the demote today fixes new scans and silently leaves every existing `dangerous` verdict standing — a half-landed fix that is harder to reason about than either end state.

Two facts make waiting cheap:

1. **The stale direction is the safe one.** An un-rescanned install keeps over-flagging, not under-flagging. Nothing becomes callable that should not be.
2. **The measured blast radius is small.** On the maintainer's 28-server install: **7 `shadowing.cross_server` findings out of 947, across 3 of 19 scanned servers.** This branch is not the noise driver (see §7 Risk 1).

Deferring also keeps Phase 1 **purely additive**: no detection-semantics change, no eval-corpus edit, no feature-doc rewrites, no persisted-state skew. The whole PR adds a field and a render path.

**Where the demote lands:** with the Phase 3 bundle-fingerprint rescan trigger, which has to invalidate stale reports anyway. Its tripwire is already in the tree — `TestShadowing_ReferenceOnOrdinaryProseIsSpannedAndStillHard` pins today's hard/dangerous behaviour and names itself as the test to flip. Flipping it will re-break the CI eval gate (shadowing recall 1.00 -> 0.50, overall 0.9310 against a 0.90 floor), because `cmd/scan-eval/gate.go` scores malicious samples at the HARD tier only; the fix is a per-entry `expected_tier` on `gateEntry` defaulting to `hard`, set to `soft` on `sh_ref_database` / `sh_ref_deploy`. That change ships **with** the demote, not before it.

### Phase 2 — reach

- `contracts.Tool.Scan *ToolScanSummary{threat_level, count, rule_ids, job_id, scanned_at}` in `internal/contracts/types.go`; populated in `enrichServerTools` (`internal/httpapi/server.go:3455`) from a write-path index on `scanner.Service` keyed by `Location`, sibling to `summaryCache` (`service.go:2256/2275`); a new `GetToolScanSummary` method on the httpapi controller interface.
- `cmd/generate-types/main.go` — hand-edit the `Tool` literal + add `ToolScanSummary`; `go run ./cmd/generate-types`; commit both or `TestContractsInSync` fails. Mirror on the hand-maintained `GlobalTool` (`frontend/src/types/api.ts:294-312`), which does **not** inherit from generated `Tool`.
- Swagger annotations + `make swagger` (all 21 scan endpoints are currently absent from `oas/swagger.yaml`).
- `Tools.vue` — Scan column, `?finding=` filter, `<ToolDescription>` in the modal (`:458-461`), `scan-settled` SSE subscription.
- Spans for `unicode.hidden` and `payload.decoded`, with field attribution and the control-rune reveal.
- Tests: `internal/httpapi/server_tools_scan_test.go` (pin `CI=""`) · `internal/security/detect/checks/unicode_hidden_span_test.go` · `frontend/tests/unit/tools-view-scan-column.spec.ts`, `tools-findings-filter.spec.ts`.

### Phase 3 — freshness, control, judgement

- `NormalizeWithSpans` in `internal/security/detect/normalize.go` + `FuzzNormalizeParity` against a frozen copy of the current output; spans for `phrase.injection` and `directive.imperative`. **Ship only if parity is proven.**
- `ScanJob.Origin` + `job_id`/`origin` on `publishScanSettled`; `maybeAutoApproveScanSettled` accepts `admission` only.
- Rescan on tool-set change in `internal/runtime/lifecycle.go` `applyDifferentialToolUpdate` (Ready-only, debounced); rescan on `BundleInfo.Fingerprint` change in `ConfigureBundle`.
- `ServerConfig.AutoBaselineScan` + all six wiring points; both UI toggles.
- **D3** — suppression is keyed per **(tool, rule, span text)**, not per (tool, rule): `storage.ToolApprovalRecord` carries suppression records capped like `MaxToolHeldSignals = 16`, applied in the scanner package at verdict time. Keying on the span text is what makes a rug-pull re-fire — the same rule matching *different* words after a description change is a new finding, not a muted one. Suppressed findings still appear in the report, greyed, with who and when.
- Tests: `internal/security/detect/normalize_parity_test.go` · `internal/server/scan_provenance_test.go` (**a rescan settle must never auto-approve**) · `internal/security/scanner/rescan_test.go` (debounce, min-interval, not-Ready skip, per-server opt-out) · `internal/config/auto_baseline_scan_test.go` (tri-state inherit) · `frontend/tests/unit/settings-auto-baseline-scan-field.spec.ts`, `server-detail-scan-optout.spec.ts`.

## 7. Risks & non-goals

**Risks**
1. **Alarm fatigue is real but comes from a DIFFERENT scanner.** Measured on the maintainer's 28-server install, latest report per server: **947 findings, 564 `dangerous`** — and **536 of those 564 come from `mcp-ai-scanner`**, not from tool descriptions: `MCP-MC-001` "Obfuscated code pattern in usr/local/lib/python3.13/_pyio.py" (405) and `MCP-MC-003` "Reverse shell or backdoor in tools.json" (131), i.e. a deep scanner flagging CPython's own standard library inside the container image. The `tpa-descriptions` scanner this design surfaces produces **329 findings, of which 7 are `dangerous`** (`shadowing.cross_server`); its bulk is `directive.imperative` at 317, already `TierSoft`/`warning`/`low` — noisy in count, correctly tiered, never blocking. **The inline UI is structurally insulated from the real noise:** `MCP-MC-*` findings carry file-path locations, so `parseToolLocation` returns `null` and they never render against a tool. An earlier draft of this document cited "7,928 findings / 6,095 high"; that figure does not reproduce and appears to have summed historical scan jobs rather than the latest report per server. The Phase 2 gate still stands — if the flagged-tool count on a real install is absurd, fix detection before putting a chip on every row — but the rule to fix first is `MCP-MC-001`, not anything in `tpa-descriptions`.
2. **Stale spans.** Nothing rescans a `manual` server after admission today, so Phase 1 spans can be arbitrarily old. `isSpanUsable` degrades honestly; Phase 3 removes the cause.
3. **`aggregate` emits one `Finding` per tool**, so a finding's `rule_id`/`threat_level` describe only the primary signal. Per-mark labelling relies on `Span.CheckID`/`Tier`, not on the finding-level fields.

**Non-goals**
1. **No sidebar count badge and no Dashboard alert until suppression exists (Phase 3).** A permanent, undismissable `99+` driven by a check we already know is leaky trains the operator to ignore it — permanently, including on the real payload. Ambient per-server chips are fine; a counting interrupt is not.
2. **No highlighting in the `Tools.vue` table cell.** It is `max-w-xs truncate` (`:336`); a mark in the clipped half is a false negative.
3. **No periodic/daily rescan.** §4.2.
4. **No client-side substring matching of `evidence`.** For the flagship rule it is a synthesized sentence (`shadowing.go:216`); for the phrase checks it is stemmed normalized text.
5. **No new `GET /api/v1/security/findings` endpoint.** Phase 1 needs none; Phase 2's `Tool.scan` rides existing payloads. A batch endpoint is a second source of truth for the same data.
6. **Not lifting the quarantined-server skip** in `handleGetGlobalTools` (`internal/httpapi/server.go:3559-3565`) — quarantined descriptions *are* the TPA payload (#1061). `GET /servers/{id}/tools` remains the review surface, which is where Phase 1 lands anyway.
7. **Not rewriting `ScanReport.vue`.** It gains four changed lines. Extracting the duplicated finding cards (`:212-303` / `:328-409`) is a separate cleanup with no user-visible payoff.
8. **Deep scan default unchanged** — off, manual-only (`IsDeepScanEnabled()` nil ⇒ false, `config.go:2971`; Spec 077 US3 FR-006).
9. ~~**Inline findings gate nothing.** `scan_informational.go:26-32` is explicit that the informational path "drives NO gating whatsoever." The panel must say so: *"Informational — these findings do not block the tool."*~~ **WITHDRAWN 2026-09-06 (UX audit F09) — this non-goal was a misreading, and shipping it put a false sentence on screen.** `scan_informational.go`'s "drives NO gating whatsoever" is about the scan TRIGGER: the automatic baseline scan neither quarantines nor auto-approves. The same comment says the verdict is stored "through the normal scan-summary path", which is exactly the summary `ApproveServer` blocks on — a hard-tier finding returns `409 server has N dangerous (hard-tier) finding(s)` (`scanner/service.go` `isBlockingFinding`), and under `trust_mode: scan` a non-clean verdict holds the individual tool (`runtime/tool_quarantine.go`, `held_reason: scan_findings`). The panel now states only what is unconditionally true of the tier — *"Findings on this server's tool descriptions. Dangerous (hard-tier) findings block server approval."* The reassurance this non-goal was reaching for (a soft-tier `directive.imperative` flood must not read as an unclearable block) survives on the soft-tier chip, whose tooltip still says *"review-only (soft-tier) signal"*. Making the panel's copy conditional on `quarantined` + effective trust mode is a live option, but it is a new component contract and a maintainer copy decision, so it was not taken.
10. **No markdown rendering and no `v-html`** anywhere in this feature.

## 8. Questions for the maintainer — ANSWERED 2026-09-01

1. **`shadowing.cross_server` precision — patch or demote?** -> **DEMOTE, and defer it (D1).** The reference branch will move to `TierSoft`; `distinctiveName()` and `commonNames` are left exactly as they are, because a stop-list patch is a guess about someone else's tool names and the next collision just moves to the next word. The clone branch stays `TierHard`. **Not shipped in Phase 1** — it waits on ruleset versioning so the change can actually propagate to existing installs; see §6a.

2. **Per-server opt-out semantics.** -> **One switch (D2).** `auto_baseline_scan: false` suppresses every automatic scan of that server — admission baseline, tool-change rescan, bundle-activation rescan. Manual scans are unaffected. Phase 3.

3. **Suppression scope.** -> **Per `(tool, rule, span text)` (D3).** The span-text key is what makes a rug-pull re-fire: the same rule matching different words after a description change is a new finding, not a muted one. Phase 3.

---

## 9. Phase 1 — known gaps at merge

- **The Playwright web-UI sweep** required by `docs/development/web-ui-verification.md` whenever `frontend/src/` is touched has **not** been run: it needs a live core, and the implementation ran under an explicit instruction not to start one (another instance holds the BBolt lock). A merge gate to clear, not a code defect.
- **Stored `tier` is not migrated** — see §6 Phase 1, "Not migrated".
- **The tool-quarantine review card** (`ServerDetail.vue`, the approve/reject surface) still renders the description as a bare `<p>` with no marks; highlighting landed on the informational Available Tools card below it. That matches the Phase 1 file list, but it is the surface where the evidence matters most — take it with the Phase 2 `Tools.vue` work.
- **`FindingChip`'s `stale` / `scanning` / `failed` states and `FlaggedToolsPanel`'s `loading` / `error` / `retry` / `stale` / `actions` slot have no production caller in Phase 1.** They are the §5 states table's contract and Phase 2/3 wires them (`Tools.vue`'s Scan column, `decideScanReconcile()`); they are unit-tested standalone in the meantime.
