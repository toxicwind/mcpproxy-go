# Settings Page (Web UI)

The Web UI **Configuration** page (`/ui/settings`) presents mcpproxy's config as
friendly, prioritized form sections instead of raw JSON:

- **Security & Access** — API key (masked, show/regenerate), require MCP auth,
  quarantine, global Docker isolation, code execution, read-only mode,
  sensitive-data detection, reveal secret headers, listen address.
- **General** — routing mode, the two response-detail modes (`tool_response_mode`
  for Retrieve, `direct_tool_response_mode` for Direct), tool limits, response
  limit, call timeout, log level, telemetry, prompts.
- **Advanced** — collapsible accordions per subsystem (code execution, Docker
  isolation, sensitive-data detection, output validation, output sanitisation,
  activity retention, logging, TLS, …).
- **Raw JSON** — the full Monaco editor, kept as an escape hatch.
- **Server Edition** — server edition only: `admin_emails`, front-door keys, OAuth provider settings and the `access` group-to-server map that decides tenant entitlement (see [Server Edition](../configuration/config-file.md#server-edition)).

## How saving works

Each section saves **only the fields you changed** via `PATCH /api/v1/config`, a
partial deep-merge that routes through the normal validate → persist → hot-reload
pipeline. Because the merge starts from the live config and overlays just your
changes, unrelated values and masked secrets (API key, secret headers) are never
overwritten.

Fields that need a restart (`listen`, `api_key`, `routing_mode`, `tls.*`,
`code_execution_pool_size`, and most of `server_edition` — `enabled`, `oauth.*`,
`public_url`, `session_cookie_secure`, `session_ttl`, `bearer_token_ttl`,
`credential_encryption_key`) show a **restart** badge — the two response-detail
modes deliberately carry no badge, because they hot-reload; likewise
`server_edition.admin_emails` and `server_edition.access` (the group-to-server
map) apply on the next request with no restart and no badge, so editing who is
an administrator or which group sees which server never needs a bounce.
Sensitive changes (reveal secret headers, disabling quarantine/management,
binding to a non-loopback address) require an explicit confirmation before they
apply.

```bash
# Equivalent API call — change one field, everything else preserved
curl -X PATCH -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"quarantine_enabled": false}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/config
```

Complex lists/maps (Docker image map, custom detection patterns, environment
vars) and `mcpServers` / `registries` are managed on their own pages or the Raw
JSON tab. See the [configuration reference](../configuration/config-file.md) for the full option list.
