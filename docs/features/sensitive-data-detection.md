# Sensitive Data Detection

MCPProxy includes automatic sensitive data detection to identify potential credential leakage, secrets exposure, and other security risks in AI agent tool calls. This feature helps protect against Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA) and provides compliance auditing capabilities.

## Overview

When AI agents interact with MCP tools, they may inadvertently expose sensitive information such as:

- **Credentials** passed in tool arguments or returned in responses
- **API tokens** leaked through error messages or debug output
- **Private keys** embedded in configuration data
- **Database connection strings** with embedded passwords

MCPProxy scans all tool call arguments and responses for sensitive data patterns, logging detections in the activity log for security review and compliance auditing.

## Activity Log Integration

When sensitive data is detected, it is recorded in the activity log metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123ABC",
  "type": "tool_call",
  "server_name": "filesystem-server",
  "tool_name": "read_file",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "sensitive_data_detected": true,
    "sensitive_data": [
      {
        "type": "aws_access_key",
        "category": "cloud_credentials",
        "severity": "critical",
        "location": "response",
        "context": "AKIA...XXXX (redacted)"
      },
      {
        "type": "private_key",
        "category": "private_key",
        "severity": "critical",
        "location": "response",
        "context": "RSA PRIVATE KEY detected"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::caution Redaction
A detection record itself never carries the value that triggered it — only the type, category, severity and location are stored.
:::

### Masked payloads

A detection is stored alongside the call it came from, and that call's arguments and response are kept for debugging. Serving those verbatim would mean the screen that warns you about a credential also prints it, in cleartext, next to a Copy button — into every screenshot, screen-share and exported page.

So MCPProxy masks them **server-side**, in the REST layer, before the record leaves the process:

- `GET /api/v1/activity` and `GET /api/v1/activity/{id}` replace every detected value inside `arguments`, `response` and `error_message` with a recognisable preview — `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` becomes `AKIA…****`. Enough to tell you *which* credential to rotate, not enough to use. A private key is replaced whole, envelope and body: its pattern matches only the `-----BEGIN …-----` line, and masking that alone would leave the key readable.
- Masking applies to records the detector flagged (`has_sensitive_data: true`); an unflagged payload is served unchanged. Detection runs asynchronously just after the call is recorded, so a record read in that sub-second window is not yet flagged and is served unmasked.
- The live event stream (`GET /events`, and therefore the tray and `mcpproxy activity watch`) masks **unconditionally**: those events are emitted at completion time, before the detector has a verdict to gate on.
- `GET /api/v1/tool-calls` and friends — a separate store with no detection metadata — mask unconditionally too.
- Internal `_auth_*` arguments (the server-edition identity MCPProxy injects into a call) are stripped from every browsing response.
- The Web UI's activity drawer and `mcpproxy activity show` both read the activity endpoints, so both are masked.

Full values remain reachable through one deliberate, separately-flagged surface for incident response and compliance:

```bash
mcpproxy activity export --include-bodies
```

That export deliberately keeps `_auth_*` as well: attributing a call to a user is the point of a compliance export.

Masking follows the same `sensitive_data_detection` categories as detection — a category you exclude is neither flagged nor masked. It does **not** follow the `enabled` flag: records flagged while detection was on stay masked after you turn it off, so disabling the feature never starts serving old credentials.

## Web UI Usage

The Activity Log page in the web UI provides filtering and visualization for sensitive data detections.

### Filtering by Sensitive Data

1. Navigate to **Activity Log** in the sidebar
2. Use the **Sensitive Data** filter dropdown to show only activities with detections
3. Filter by severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
4. Click on an activity row to view detection details

### Detection Indicators

Activities with sensitive data detections are marked with visual indicators:

- Red shield icon for critical severity
- Orange warning icon for high severity
- Yellow info icon for medium severity
- Gray info icon for low severity

### Detail View

Clicking on an activity with detections shows:

- List of all detected sensitive data types
- Location (arguments or response)
- Timestamp and duration
- The request arguments and response body, with every detected value masked (`AKIA…****`) and both panels badged **Masked** — see [Masked payloads](#masked-payloads)

## CLI Usage

### List Activities with Sensitive Data

```bash
# Show all activities with sensitive data detections
mcpproxy activity list --sensitive-data

# Filter by severity
mcpproxy activity list --sensitive-data --severity critical

# Combine with other filters
mcpproxy activity list --sensitive-data --server github-server --status success
```

### View Detection Details

```bash
# Show full details including sensitive data metadata
mcpproxy activity show 01JFXYZ123ABC

# JSON output for scripting
mcpproxy activity show 01JFXYZ123ABC --output json
```

### Export for Compliance

```bash
# Export activities with sensitive data for security review
mcpproxy activity export --sensitive-data --output security-audit.jsonl

# Export critical severity only
mcpproxy activity export --sensitive-data --severity critical --output critical-findings.jsonl
```

### Summary Statistics

```bash
# Show sensitive data detection summary
mcpproxy activity summary --period 24h

# Output includes detection counts by category and severity
```

## Configuration

Sensitive data detection is enabled by default. Configure via `mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "sensitive_data_detection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "scan_arguments": true,
    "scan_responses": true,
    "severity_threshold": "low",
    "categories": {
      "cloud_credentials": true,
      "private_key": true,
      "api_token": true,
      "auth_token": true,
      "sensitive_file": true,
      "database_credential": true,
      "high_entropy": true,
      "credit_card": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | true | Enable/disable sensitive data detection |
| `scan_arguments` | true | Scan tool call arguments |
| `scan_responses` | true | Scan tool call responses |
| `severity_threshold` | "low" | Minimum severity to log (low, medium, high, critical) |
| `categories.*` | true | Enable/disable specific detection categories |

See [Configuration](/configuration/sensitive-data-detection) for complete reference.

## Cross-Platform Support

Sensitive file path detection adapts to the operating system:

| Platform | Path Patterns |
|----------|---------------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.config/` |
| **Linux** | `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.config/`, `/etc/ssl/private/` |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\`, `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\`, `%APPDATA%\` |

Path detection normalizes separators and expands home directory references for consistent cross-platform detection.

## Security Best Practices

### Compliance Auditing

Use sensitive data detection for regular security audits:

```bash
# Weekly security audit export
mcpproxy activity export \
  --sensitive-data \
  --start-time "$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z)" \
  --output weekly-security-audit.jsonl

# Generate summary report
mcpproxy activity summary --period 7d --output json > weekly-summary.json
```

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor for critical detections in real-time:

```bash
# Watch for sensitive data detections
mcpproxy activity watch --sensitive-data --severity critical
```

### Integration with SIEM

Export activity logs for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:

```bash
# Continuous export for SIEM ingestion
mcpproxy activity export --format json --output - | \
  your-siem-forwarder --input -
```

For a schema-pinned, redacted, attribution-focused stream instead — one line per
authorization decision, tool call and login attempt, with no proxy-side read
surface — see the [Audit Log](audit-log.md), which most SIEM pipelines should
tail directly rather than polling `activity export`.

### Incident Response

When a critical detection is identified:

1. **Review the activity**: `mcpproxy activity show <id>`
2. **Identify the source**: Check server name and tool name
3. **Assess impact**: Determine if credentials were exposed externally
4. **Rotate credentials**: If exposed, rotate the affected credentials immediately
5. **Investigate root cause**: Review how sensitive data entered the tool call

### Prevention Recommendations

1. **Use Docker isolation** for untrusted servers with `network_mode: "none"`
2. **Enable quarantine** for new servers added by AI agents
3. **Review tool descriptions** for potential data exfiltration patterns
4. **Set up alerts** for critical severity detections
5. **Regular audits** of activity logs for security compliance
