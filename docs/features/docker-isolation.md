# Security Isolation (Docker · Sandbox · None)

MCPProxy can confine stdio MCP servers so a malicious or buggy server cannot freely touch the host. There are **three isolation modes** — `docker`, `sandbox`, and `none` — selected by `docker_isolation.mode` (global) or `isolation.mode` (per-server). Most of this page describes **Docker** mode (the default and most capable); see [Isolation Modes](#isolation-modes) for the native **Sandbox** mode and the scanner behaviour under each mode.

:::note
The global config key is still `docker_isolation` for backward compatibility, but its `mode` field selects any of the three modes — it is not Docker-only.
:::

## Overview

Docker isolation automatically wraps stdio-based MCP servers in Docker containers, providing:

- **Process Isolation**: Each server runs in a separate container
- **File System Isolation**: Servers cannot access host file system
- **Network Isolation**: Configurable network modes for security
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Automatic Runtime Detection**: Maps commands to appropriate Docker images

## Isolation Modes

MCPProxy resolves an **isolation mode** for every stdio server. Set it globally with `docker_isolation.mode` and override per-server with `isolation.mode`:

| Mode | What it does | Where it works | uid/gid drop |
|------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| `docker` | Wraps the server in a Docker container (process/FS/network isolation, resource limits). The default and most capable mode. | Any host with a working Docker daemon. | Yes (container user) |
| `sandbox` | Runs the server **natively** under a Linux [Landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html) filesystem allowlist + `setrlimit` resource caps — **no Docker required**. For hosts where Docker isolation is unavailable or broken (e.g. snap-docker + AppArmor). | Linux 5.13+ only. macOS/Windows: documented no-op ⇒ behaves like `none`. | **No** — see [Honest limitations](#honest-limitations) |
| `none` | No confinement; the server runs directly on the host. | Everywhere. | n/a |

```json
{
  "docker_isolation": { "mode": "sandbox" },
  "mcpServers": [
    { "name": "trusted-local", "command": "uvx", "args": ["x"], "isolation": { "mode": "none" } }
  ]
}
```

### Back-compat with the legacy `enabled` flag

The older boolean `docker_isolation.enabled` (and per-server `isolation.enabled`) still works and is mapped to a mode:

- an explicit `mode` always wins;
- otherwise `enabled: true` ⇒ `docker`, `enabled: false` ⇒ `none`;
- a missing isolation config ⇒ `none`.

Per-server precedence: explicit per-server `mode` → per-server legacy `enabled` → global `mode` → global legacy `enabled`.

### Sandbox mode (Landlock)

`sandbox` mode confines a stdio server **without Docker** by applying a Linux Landlock LSM ruleset (a writable-path allowlist) plus `setrlimit` resource caps to the process before it `exec`s, then preserving the raw stdin/stdout JSON-RPC pipes. It needs no user namespaces, so it is unaffected by `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` — which is exactly why it works where bubblewrap/userns-based sandboxes are blocked (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04 with snap-docker).

### Scanner behaviour under each mode (MCP-34.4)

The security **scanner plugins** are Docker-based and, since Spec 077, belong to the **opt-in deep-scan layer** (they run only when `security.deep_scan.enabled: true`). Under a non-Docker isolation mode they cannot run at all, so MCPProxy **skips them and surfaces the skip informationally** rather than failing silently:

| Mode | Docker scanner plugins | In-process scanner (`tpa-descriptions`) | Scan result for a server with only Docker scanners |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `docker` | Run normally (when deep scan is on) | Runs | As scanned |
| `sandbox` / `none` | **Skipped** with an honest, mode-specific reason pointing at [`MCPX_DOCKER_SNAP_APPARMOR`](/errors/MCPX_DOCKER_SNAP_APPARMOR) | **Still runs** | The baseline verdict is unchanged; the skip surfaces via the informational `deep_scan` descriptor |

Since Spec 077 (FR-008) a skipped or failed deep scanner **never downgrades the baseline verdict to `degraded`** — the old `security_scan.status: "degraded"` behaviour was removed. The always-emitted `deep_scan` descriptor carries the skip instead: `{ "enabled": <bool>, "ran": <bool>, "available": <bool>, "scanners_failed": [...], "skipped_scanners": [...] }`. The deterministic in-process `tpa-descriptions` baseline scanner is the sole source of the verdict, so a low/zero risk score from a baseline-only scan is a trustworthy result, and the incomplete Docker coverage is reported as an informational note. To run the full Docker-based scanner fleet, enable deep scan and use `mode: docker` on a host with a working Docker daemon, or replace snap-docker with a distro Docker package (see the error doc). The skip is also logged at startup:

```
WARN  Isolation mode runs no Docker for scanner plugins; Docker-based scanners will be skipped …  {"isolation_mode": "sandbox"}
```

## Configuration

### Global Docker Isolation

Add to your `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "docker_isolation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "memory_limit": "512m",
    "cpu_limit": "1.0",
    "timeout": "60s",
    "network_mode": "bridge",
    "registry": "docker.io",
    "default_images": {
      "python": "ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim",
      "python3": "ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim",
      "uvx": "ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim",
      "pip": "ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim",
      "pipx": "ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim",
      "node": "node:22",
      "npm": "node:22",
      "npx": "node:22",
      "yarn": "node:22",
      "go": "golang:1.21-alpine",
      "cargo": "rust:1.75-slim",
      "rustc": "rust:1.75-slim",
      "ruby": "ruby:3.2-alpine",
      "gem": "ruby:3.2-alpine",
      "php": "php:8.2-cli-alpine",
      "composer": "php:8.2-cli-alpine",
      "binary": "alpine:3.18",
      "sh": "alpine:3.18",
      "bash": "alpine:3.18"
    },
    "extra_args": []
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable Docker isolation globally | `false` |
| `memory_limit` | Memory limit per container | `"512m"` |
| `cpu_limit` | CPU limit per container | `"1.0"` |
| `timeout` | Container startup timeout | `"30s"` |
| `network_mode` | Docker network mode | `"bridge"` |
| `registry` | Docker registry to use | `"docker.io"` |
| `default_images` | Runtime to image mappings. The optional `uvx-git` key (not shipped in the defaults) overrides the git-capable image used when a Python runner installs from a `git+` URL | See above |
| `extra_args` | Additional docker run arguments | `[]` |

### Git dependencies (`uvx-git`)

The Python default image is Astral's **slim** `uv` image, which does not contain
`git`. A server installed straight from a repository —

```json
{ "name": "my-server", "command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "my-server@git+https://github.com/o/r", "my-server"] }
```

— cannot resolve without it, and fails with `Git executable not found` /
`Git operation failed` ([`MCPX_DOCKER_MISSING_TOOLCHAIN`](../errors/MCPX_DOCKER_MISSING_TOOLCHAIN.md)).

MCPProxy detects the `git+` URL in a Python package runner's arguments and runs
that server only on a git-capable image — everyone else keeps the small slim
image. By default that is `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm`, which
ships git. Set the **`uvx-git`** key to use your own mirror or a custom build:

```json
{ "docker_isolation": { "default_images": { "uvx-git": "my-registry.example/uv-git:1" } } }
```

`default_images` from your config file is merged **over** the built-in map, so a
partial map like the one above only changes the keys it lists — every other
runtime keeps its built-in image.

**Mirrored / air-gapped registries.** `uvx-git` is deliberately *not* part of
the built-in map, so its presence in your config means exactly one thing: you
chose that image, and it is used — even if you set it to the same public value
MCPProxy ships. Two things follow:

- If you set `registry`, the built-in git-capable image is pulled from **your**
  registry (`<registry>/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm`) rather than from
  `ghcr.io`.
- If you retargeted `uvx`/`python` at your own registry and never set
  `uvx-git`, the server runs on **your** image instead of MCPProxy reaching
  outside your registry for a public one, and a warning naming this key is
  logged. Point `uvx-git` at a git-capable image to get the substitution back:

```json
{ "docker_isolation": { "default_images": { "uvx-git": "mirror.internal/astral/uv:python3.13-bookworm" } } }
```

To turn the substitution off entirely, set the key to an empty string; those
servers then keep whatever `uvx`/`python` image you configured:

```json
{ "docker_isolation": { "default_images": { "uvx-git": "" } } }
```

A per-server `isolation.image` override always wins over this selection, so a
pinned image must ship git itself. `node`/`npx` need no equivalent: `node:22`
already includes git, and the substitution never applies to them.

### Per-Server Configuration

You can override isolation settings per server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "custom-python-server",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "my_server"],
      "isolation": {
        "enabled": true,
        "image": "my-custom-python:latest",
        "network_mode": "none",
        "working_dir": "/app",
        "extra_args": ["--cap-drop=ALL"]
      },
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "no-isolation-server",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "trusted_server"],
      "isolation": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Runtime Detection

MCPProxy automatically detects the runtime type based on the command:

### Python Environments
- `python`, `python3` → `python:3.11`
- `uvx` → `python:3.11` (includes uv package manager)
- `pip`, `pipx` → `python:3.11`

### Node.js Environments
- `node` → `node:20`
- `npm`, `npx` → `node:20`
- `yarn` → `node:20`

### Other Languages
- `go` → `golang:1.21-alpine`
- `cargo`, `rustc` → `rust:1.75-slim`
- `ruby`, `gem` → `ruby:3.2-alpine`
- `php`, `composer` → `php:8.2-cli-alpine`

### Shell/Binary
- `sh`, `bash` → `alpine:3.18`
- Unknown commands → `alpine:3.18`

## Why Full Images Instead of Slim/Alpine?

MCPProxy uses full Docker images (`python:3.11` instead of `python:3.11-slim`) because:

1. **Git Support**: Many MCP servers install packages from Git repositories using `git+https://` URLs
2. **Build Tools**: Some packages require compilation during installation
3. **System Dependencies**: Full images include common libraries needed by MCP servers

This trade-off prioritizes compatibility over image size.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables from server configuration are automatically passed to containers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "api-server",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["some-package"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-secret-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

These become Docker arguments: `-e API_KEY=your-secret-key -e DEBUG=true`

## Docker-in-Docker Prevention

MCPProxy automatically skips isolation for servers that are already Docker commands:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "existing-docker-server",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/some-server"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This prevents Docker-in-Docker complications.

## Debugging

### Check Docker Isolation Status

```bash
# Run with debug logging
mcpproxy serve --log-level=debug

# Filter for isolation messages
mcpproxy serve --log-level=debug 2>&1 | grep -i "docker isolation"
```

### Monitor Docker Containers

```bash
# List MCPProxy containers
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"

# View logs from a specific container
docker logs <container-id>

# Watch container resource usage
docker stats
```

### Common Issues

**Container startup timeouts:**
- Increase `timeout` in docker_isolation config
- Check if Docker images need to be pulled
- Verify network connectivity for package installations

**Environment variables not working:**
- Check that variables are defined in server `env` section
- Use debug logging to see Docker command arguments
- Verify container has access to required environment

**Git/package installation failures:**
- Ensure using full images (`python:3.11` not `python:3.11-slim`)
- Check container logs for specific error messages
- Verify network access for package repositories

## Container Lifecycle

### Startup

When a Docker-isolated server starts:
1. MCPProxy detects runtime type (npm, uvx, python, etc.)
2. Selects appropriate Docker image
3. Runs container with stdio transport (`docker run -i`)
4. Establishes MCP connection via stdin/stdout

### Shutdown

When MCPProxy stops, containers are cleaned up with a 30-second timeout:

1. **Graceful Stop**: `docker stop` (sends SIGTERM to container)
2. **Force Kill**: `docker kill` if container doesn't stop gracefully

Containers are labeled with `com.mcpproxy.managed=true` for identification
and `com.mcpproxy.server=<server name>` (the raw, unsanitised name) for
ownership.

### Container ownership

Every container mcpproxy creates is named
`mcpproxy-<sanitised server name>-<4 random chars>`. The name alone does not
identify the server — `a/b` and `a-b` both sanitise to `a-b` — so every
cleanup path (the pre-start sweep for stale containers, the container
captured from `--cidfile`, the disconnect fallbacks by exact name, by name
pattern and by image name) inspects the container and stops or removes it
only when its `com.mcpproxy.server` label **and** canonical name both match
the server being cleaned up — and it re-inspects the container immediately
before every `docker stop`, `kill` or `rm -f` (the kill after a failed stop
included), never acting on an earlier listing, so a container renamed,
relabelled or replaced in between is left alone. Containers you started yourself with
`docker run --name …`, or that pre-date the label, are never touched by any
of these paths, and a container that merely shares an image with a server's
is never stopped on that server's behalf. Housekeeping records in the
per-server log carry `container_owner` (the label value read back from
Docker) so [`tail_log`](/features/agent-tokens) can attribute them to the
right server; the pre-start "Docker isolation configured" record names the
generated container name before Docker has created anything and carries no
owner. The child process's own output lines (the docker CLI's stderr
included) are written to the per-server log as the `message` field of a
`stderr` or `launcher` record marked `child_output`, never as the record
text.

Two consequences of the ownership rule are worth knowing:

- **Servers you configure as `docker run …` yourself** (no isolation) get no
  `com.mcpproxy.server` label — MCPProxy only labels the containers it
  builds for isolation — so MCPProxy never stops or removes their
  container, not even through the `--cidfile` it injects into your command.
  Use `--rm` (and let the container exit when its stdin closes) or stop it
  by hand; earlier versions would stop it via the cidfile and, if that
  capture failed, every container on the same image, yours or not.
- **Renaming a server** changes the label value a container must carry. A
  container created under the old name is no longer owned by the new one,
  so it is left alone by the pre-start sweep and must be removed manually
  (`docker rm -f`).
- **The shutdown and emergency sweeps** (every `com.mcpproxy.managed`
  container on shutdown; every one carrying this instance's id when
  shutdown fails) apply the same rule: only containers canonically owned by
  a server in the current configuration are stopped or removed — each one
  re-inspected immediately before its stop, kill or removal through the
  same check every per-server cleanup uses, so a container renamed or
  relabelled after the sweep listed it is left alone — and the
  disconnect-timeout path re-checks the ownership of the id it tracked
  before `docker rm -f`. A container that merely carries the mcpproxy
  labels — one you labelled yourself, or an orphan of a server that is no
  longer configured — is left alone and only counted in a warning, never
  named. Remove such orphans by hand (see below).

### Manual Cleanup

If containers remain after MCPProxy stops:

```bash
# List MCPProxy-managed containers
docker ps --filter "label=com.mcpproxy.managed=true"

# Remove all MCPProxy containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -q --filter "label=com.mcpproxy.managed=true")
```

See [Shutdown Behavior](/operations/shutdown-behavior) for detailed subprocess lifecycle documentation.

## Honest limitations

`sandbox` mode is deliberately scoped. Known limitations:

- **No uid/gid drop.** Dropping to an unprivileged uid/gid requires `CAP_SETUID`/`CAP_SETGID` (i.e. running as root). When mcpproxy runs unprivileged, the uid/gid drop is **best-effort and typically a no-op** — the sandboxed process keeps the launching user's identity. Landlock (filesystem) and `setrlimit` (resource caps) still apply. Docker mode does drop to a container user. This is an honest trade-off, not a bug.
- **Linux-only.** Landlock is a Linux 5.13+ feature. On older kernels the launcher degrades best-effort (fewer access-right bits enforced). On macOS/Windows `sandbox` is a documented **no-op** and behaves like `none`.
- **Filesystem + resources only.** Landlock confines the filesystem write-allowlist; it does not provide network namespacing. For network-sensitive servers, use `docker` mode with `network_mode: none`.
- **Docker-based scanners do not run under `sandbox`/`none`.** They are skipped and the skip is surfaced via the informational `deep_scan` descriptor — it never downgrades the baseline verdict (Spec 077 FR-008). A native scanner runtime is a future enhancement.

## Platform support matrix

| Platform | `docker` | `sandbox` | `none` | Docker scanner plugins |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| Linux (kernel ≥ 5.13) | ✅ (needs Docker daemon) | ✅ Landlock + rlimits (no uid/gid drop) | ✅ | ✅ under `docker` (deep scan on); skipped (informational, no verdict change) under `sandbox`/`none` |
| Linux (kernel &lt; 5.13) | ✅ (needs Docker daemon) | ⚠️ best-effort: rlimits apply, Landlock partial/unavailable | ✅ | same as above |
| macOS | ✅ (Docker Desktop) | ⚠️ no-op ⇒ effectively `none` | ✅ | ✅ under `docker`; n/a otherwise |
| Windows | ✅ (Docker Desktop) | ⚠️ no-op ⇒ effectively `none` | ✅ | ✅ under `docker`; n/a otherwise |

## Security Considerations

Docker isolation provides strong security boundaries but consider:

1. **Network Access**: Containers can still access the network by default
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory/CPU limits
3. **Image Trust**: Use trusted base images from official repositories
4. **Secrets**: Environment variables are visible in container inspect output

For maximum security, consider:
- Using `"network_mode": "none"` for servers that don't need network access
- Adding `--cap-drop=ALL` to extra_args to remove Linux capabilities
- Using custom minimal images for specific use cases
