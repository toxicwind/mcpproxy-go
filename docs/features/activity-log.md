# Activity Log

MCPProxy provides comprehensive activity logging to track AI agent tool calls, policy decisions, and system events. This enables debugging, auditing, and compliance monitoring.

## What Gets Logged

The activity log captures:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `tool_call` | Every tool call made through MCPProxy |
| `system_start` | MCPProxy server startup events |
| `system_stop` | MCPProxy server shutdown events |
| `internal_tool_call` | Internal proxy tool calls (retrieve_tools, call_tool_*, code_execution, etc.) |
| `config_change` | Configuration changes (server added/removed/updated) |
| `policy_decision` | Tool calls blocked by policy rules |
| `quarantine_change` | Server quarantine/unquarantine events |
| `server_change` | Server enable/disable/restart events |
| `credential_broker` | Per-user `oauth_connect` consent/callback outcomes (`connect` is the only action ever recorded; the credential is stored, never injected) — server edition only |

### System Lifecycle Events

System lifecycle events track when MCPProxy starts and stops:

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123DEF",
  "type": "system_start",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "version": "v0.5.0",
    "listen_address": "127.0.0.1:8080",
    "startup_duration_ms": 150,
    "config_path": "/Users/user/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json"
  }
}
```

### Internal Tool Call Events

Internal tool calls log when internal proxy tools are used:

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123GHI",
  "type": "internal_tool_call",
  "status": "success",
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:05:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "internal_tool_name": "call_tool_read",
    "target_server": "github-server",
    "target_tool": "get_user",
    "tool_variant": "call_tool_read",
    "intent": {
      "operation_type": "read",
      "data_sensitivity": "public"
    }
  }
}
```

:::note Duplicate Filtering
By default, all `call_tool_*` internal tool calls (`call_tool_read`, `call_tool_write`, `call_tool_destructive`) are excluded from activity listings — every dispatch (successful, failed, or shed) has a corresponding upstream `tool_call` or rejection record carrying the same `request_id`, so showing both would double-count the call.

To include the `call_tool_*` records anyway, use `include_call_tool=true` in the API query parameter.
:::

### Config Change Events

Configuration changes are logged for audit trails:

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123JKL",
  "type": "config_change",
  "server_name": "github-server",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:10:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "action": "server_added",
    "affected_entity": "github-server",
    "source": "mcp",
    "new_values": {
      "name": "github-server",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Call Records

Each tool call record includes:

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123ABC",
  "type": "tool_call",
  "server_name": "github-server",
  "tool_name": "create_issue",
  "tool_variant": "call_tool_write",
  "arguments": {"title": "Bug report", "body": "..."},
  "response": "Issue #123 created",
  "status": "success",
  "duration_ms": 245,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "session_id": "mcp-session-abc123",
  "request_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "intent": {
    "operation_type": "write",
    "data_sensitivity": "internal",
    "reason": "Creating bug report per user request"
  }
}
```

#### Sub-calls made by code_execution

Every upstream tool call a sandboxed `code_execution` script makes is recorded
as a first-class `tool_call` record with its own `request_id` and a `parent_id`
equal to the parent `code_execution` record's `request_id` (`source` is
`internal`; a policy-refused sub-call is recorded with status `blocked`).
Filter with `parent_id=<parent request_id>` to list a script's sub-calls, or
`request_id=<child's parent_id>` to find the parent — the Web UI drawer, the
macOS Activity window, and `mcpproxy activity list --parent-id` all expose the
same navigation (see the "Drill into a code_execution" workflow in the CLI
activity commands reference).

### Intent Tracking

Every tool call includes intent information for security auditing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tool_variant` | Which tool was used: `call_tool_read`, `call_tool_write`, `call_tool_destructive` |
| `intent.operation_type` | Agent's declared intent: `read`, `write`, `destructive` |
| `intent.data_sensitivity` | Data classification: `public`, `internal`, `private`, `unknown` |
| `intent.reason` | Agent's explanation for the operation |

### Sensitive Data Detection

Activity records automatically include sensitive data detection metadata when MCPProxy detects potentially sensitive information in tool arguments or responses. This helps identify data handling patterns and supports compliance monitoring.

```json
{
  "id": "01JFXYZ123ABC",
  "type": "tool_call",
  "server_name": "github-server",
  "tool_name": "create_issue",
  "status": "success",
  "metadata": {
    "sensitive_data_detection": {
      "detected": true,
      "categories": ["api_key", "email"],
      "argument_detections": [
        {
          "field": "body",
          "category": "api_key",
          "confidence": 0.95
        }
      ],
      "response_detections": [
        {
          "field": "author.email",
          "category": "email",
          "confidence": 0.99
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `detected` | Whether any sensitive data was detected |
| `categories` | List of detected sensitive data categories |
| `argument_detections` | Detections in tool call arguments |
| `response_detections` | Detections in tool call responses |

Filter activity by sensitive data:

```bash
# Show only activity with detected sensitive data
mcpproxy activity list --has-sensitive-data

# Filter by specific category
mcpproxy activity list --sensitive-category api_key

# REST API
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?has_sensitive_data=true"
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?sensitive_category=api_key"
```

See [Sensitive Data Detection](/features/sensitive-data-detection) for details on detection categories, configuration options, and compliance use cases.

Filter by intent type:

```bash
# Show only destructive operations
mcpproxy activity list --intent-type destructive

# REST API
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?intent_type=destructive"
```

See [Intent Declaration](/features/intent-declaration) for details on the intent-based permission system.

### Request ID Correlation

Every activity record includes a `request_id` that links to the HTTP request that triggered it. This is useful for:

- **Error debugging**: When an API error occurs, the error response includes the `request_id`. Use it to find related activity:

```bash
# Error response includes request_id
# { "error": "tool call failed", "request_id": "abc123..." }

# Find activity for that request
mcpproxy activity list --request-id abc123...
```

- **Request tracing**: Track all tool calls made during a single API request.

- **Log correlation**: The same `request_id` appears in server logs, enabling end-to-end request tracing.

Filter by request ID:

```bash
# CLI
mcpproxy activity list --request-id a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# REST API
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?request_id=a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
```

## CLI Commands

MCPProxy provides dedicated CLI commands for activity log access. See the full [Activity Commands Reference](/cli/activity-commands) for details.

### Quick Examples

```bash
# List recent activity
mcpproxy activity list

# List last 10 tool call errors
mcpproxy activity list --type tool_call --status error --limit 10

---

## REST API

### List Activity

```bash
GET /api/v1/activity
```

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Filter by type (comma-separated for multiple): `tool_call`, `system_start`, `system_stop`, `internal_tool_call`, `config_change`, `policy_decision`, `quarantine_change`, `server_change`, `credential_broker` (server edition; connect-flow outcomes only) |
| `server` | string | Filter by server name |
| `tool` | string | Filter by tool name |
| `session_id` | string | Filter by MCP session ID |
| `status` | string | Filter by status: `success`, `error`, `blocked` |
| `start_time` | string | Filter after this time (RFC3339) |
| `end_time` | string | Filter before this time (RFC3339) |
| `limit` | integer | Max records (1-100, default: 50) |
| `offset` | integer | Pagination offset (default: 0) |
| `include_call_tool` | boolean | Include `call_tool_*` internal tool calls (default: false). Excluded by default because every dispatch has a paired `tool_call` (or rejection) record with the same `request_id`. |
| `parent_id` | string | Return only the sub-calls one `code_execution` issued (value = the parent record's `request_id`). Child→parent is the reverse lookup: `request_id=<child's parent_id>`. |
| `exclude_payloads` | boolean | Omit the bulky fields — `arguments`, `response` — and narrow `metadata` to a contextual whitelist (default: false). See below. |

#### `exclude_payloads` and the contextual metadata whitelist

`exclude_payloads=true` is a projection, not a filter: it never changes which
records match, only how much of each record is serialized. It exists for clients
that poll frequently and render summary fields only (the macOS tray glance polls
the newest 100 records on every menu open). Measured against a real log those
100 records are ~848 KB whole and ~30 KB projected.

The projection drops `arguments` and `response` entirely, and keeps only these
`metadata` keys:

| Kept key | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `intent.reason` | The caller's stated reason, rendered as the row subtitle |
| `intent.operation_type` | `read` / `write` / `destructive` |
| `decision` | `blocked`, `warned`, … for `policy_decision` records |
| `reason` | Why a policy decision blocked or warned |
| `client_name` | Which MCP client made the call |
| `client_version` | Its version |

Everything else in `metadata` — sensitive-data detection payloads, toon
renderings, classifier scores, raw intent objects — is dropped. Whitelisted keys
that a record does not have are simply omitted, and a record whose metadata is
entirely non-whitelisted serializes with no `metadata` object at all.

Every kept key is kept only when its value is a **string**. A whitelisted key is
not a promise about its value: a producer that writes a structured error under
`reason` would otherwise smuggle that whole payload through the projection, so
non-string values are dropped like any other non-whitelisted content.

Two things survive the projection deliberately:

- `has_sensitive_data` is derived from `metadata` **before** it is narrowed, so
  the flag outlives its source.
- `request_id` is a top-level field, not metadata, so correlation still works on
  projected responses.

Fetch the full record with `GET /api/v1/activity/{id}` when a client needs the
arguments, the response, or any non-whitelisted metadata.

**Example:**

```bash
# List recent tool calls
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?type=tool_call&limit=10"

# Filter by multiple types (comma-separated)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?type=tool_call,internal_tool_call,config_change"

# List system lifecycle events
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?type=system_start,system_stop"

# Filter by server
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?server=github-server"

curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?start_time=2025-01-15T00:00:00Z"

# Summary-only poll: no arguments/response, metadata narrowed to the whitelist
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?type=tool_call,internal_tool_call,policy_decision&limit=100&exclude_payloads=true"
```

```

## Real-time Events

Activity events are streamed via SSE for real-time monitoring:

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:8080/events?apikey=$KEY"
```

**Events:**

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `activity.tool_call.started` | Tool call initiated |
| `activity.tool_call.completed` | Tool call finished (success or error) |
| `activity.policy_decision` | Tool call blocked by policy |

**Example Event:**

```json
event: activity.tool_call.completed
data: {"id":"01JFXYZ123ABC","server":"github-server","tool":"create_issue","status":"success","duration_ms":245}
```

## Configuration

Activity logging is enabled by default. Configure via `mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "activity_retention_days": 90,
  "activity_max_records": 100000,
  "activity_max_size_mb": 256,
  "activity_max_response_size": 65536,
  "activity_cleanup_interval_min": 60
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `activity_retention_days` | 90 | Days to retain activity records |
| `activity_max_records` | 100000 | Maximum records before pruning oldest |
| `activity_max_size_mb` | 256 | Maximum total activity-log size in MB before pruning oldest (`0` disables). Runs alongside the age and count caps to bound `config.db` growth when records carry large payloads. An explicit `0` now survives a config save — before #1175 it was silently deleted on the next write and the 256MB cap came back. |
| `activity_max_response_size` | 65536 | Max response text stored per record (bytes). Applies to `tool_call`, `internal_tool_call` and `prompt_get`; `0` or absent falls back to 65536 and it cannot be disabled. Read at startup only, like its retention siblings. Truncated text keeps a `...[truncated]` suffix. Already-stored records are not rewritten, and (as with pruning) the BBolt file does not shrink on disk. Sensitive-data detection still scans the untruncated response, under its own `sensitive_data_detection.max_payload_size_kb` cap. |
| `activity_cleanup_interval_min` | 60 | Background cleanup interval (minutes) |

> **Why the size cap?** The age and count caps alone do not bound disk: with large per-record payloads the log can reach hundreds of MB while still under 100k records / 90 days. `activity_max_size_mb` removes the oldest records (always keeping the newest) until the log is within the byte budget. Note: pruning frees pages for reuse but does not shrink the database file on disk (BBolt does not return freed pages to the OS).

## Tool-call history

The activity log is not the only per-call store. `GET /api/v1/tool-calls` is served from separate per-server buckets (`server_<id>_tool_calls`) that hold a recent debugging window: the full arguments and the upstream result, per server. On one deployment these held ~432MB of a 940MB `config.db` because nothing bounded them at all (#1176).

```json
{
  "tool_call_max_response_size": 65536,
  "tool_call_max_records_per_server": 1000
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `tool_call_max_response_size` | 65536 | Cap on the marshalled response stored per tool-call record, in bytes. Over the cap the stored `response` is replaced by `{"truncated": true, "original_bytes": N, "preview": "…"}` and the record carries `response_truncated: true` with `response_bytes: N`. The caller still received the response whole — only the stored copy is shortened. |
| `tool_call_max_records_per_server` | 1000 | Calls retained per server. The oldest are evicted in the same transaction as the write, so the bucket can never exceed the cap. |

A non-positive value means "use the default", not "disable" — this store has no off switch. Removing a server now drops its call history with it, and histories belonging to servers that are no longer configured are swept on startup (the synthetic `code_execution` history is never swept).

> **Reclaiming the space.** All of the above bounds *future* growth. BBolt does not return freed pages to the operating system, so an already-large `config.db` stays large. Use `mcpproxy db stats` to see how much is reclaimable and `mcpproxy db compact` — with mcpproxy stopped — to shrink the file. See [docs/cli/db-commands.md](../cli/db-commands.md).

## Use Cases

### Debugging Tool Calls

View recent tool calls to debug issues:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?type=tool_call&status=error&limit=10"
```

### Compliance Auditing

Export activity for compliance review:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity/export?format=csv&start_time=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  > audit-q1-2025.csv
```

### Session Analysis

Track all activity for a specific AI session:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/activity?session_id=mcp-session-abc123"
```

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor tool calls in real-time:

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:8080/events?apikey=$KEY" | grep "activity.tool_call"
```

## Storage

Activity records are stored in BBolt database at `~/.mcpproxy/config.db`. The background cleanup process automatically prunes old records based on retention settings.

:::tip Performance
Activity logging is non-blocking and uses an event-driven architecture to minimize impact on tool call latency.
