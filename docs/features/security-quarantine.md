# Security Quarantine

MCPProxy includes an automatic quarantine system to protect against Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA).

## What is a Tool Poisoning Attack?

Tool Poisoning Attacks occur when malicious MCP servers:

1. **Hidden Instructions**: Embed malicious instructions in tool descriptions that AI agents might follow
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Trick AI agents into sending sensitive data to external servers
3. **Credential Theft**: Attempt to extract API keys or tokens
4. **System Manipulation**: Try to execute unauthorized commands

## How Quarantine Works

### Automatic Quarantine

When a new server is added via an AI client (using the `upstream_servers` tool):

1. Server is automatically placed in **quarantine status**
2. Tool calls to quarantined servers return a **security analysis** instead of executing
3. Server remains quarantined until **manually approved**

### Servers added by hand-editing `mcp_config.json`

Since issue #937, the same admission gate applies to servers written directly
into the configuration file — hand-editing is a normal workflow, and config
files get shared, templated and copied between machines, so an entry from a
config edit is admitted on exactly the same terms as one from
`mcpproxy upstream add`.

A config-file server is held for review when **both** of the following are true:

- the entry does **not** contain a `quarantined` key (writing `"quarantined": false`
  is an explicit operator statement and is obeyed), **and**
- the server is not yet recorded in `config.db`.

The second condition is what makes upgrading safe: every server you are already
running has a `config.db` record, so **upgrading never re-quarantines a server
you have already vetted**. The boundary is that a server present in a
hand-written config but absent from `config.db` — after a wiped data directory,
or on a machine that has never seen that config before — is treated as
first-seen and held for review.

The decision is durable: once recorded, a quarantine is not reverted by a config
file that never mentions the key. Un-quarantining stays a user action, and
writes both the config file and `config.db`.

No TPA scan runs at config-load admission; quarantine-by-default already keeps
the tools away from agents, and the scan is what the human review step performs.

If mcpproxy writes the configuration file itself (any API apply, a quarantine
toggle, an `upstream add`), it does **not** stamp `"quarantined": false` onto
servers that never stated it — a value mcpproxy invented would otherwise read
back as an operator statement and disable the gate for that server.

#### Upgrading from a release affected by #937 — action required

The gate treats "present in `config.db`" as "has already been through
admission". That is what keeps upgrades safe, but it also means an install that
was **already** hit by #937 is not remediated by upgrading: the buggy admission
left exactly the `config.db` record the gate now reads as vetted, so a server
that was admitted unquarantined stays live.

At startup mcpproxy logs a warning naming any server that looks like this —
configured, running unquarantined, never explicitly reviewed, and with a
`trust_mode` that would have held it:

```
Configured servers predate the config-load admission gate and have never been
explicitly reviewed  servers=["suspicious-server"]
```

For each server named, either:

- review it and record the decision — quarantining and then releasing it from
  the quarantine UI writes an explicit `"quarantined"` value to
  `mcp_config.json`, which silences the warning; or
- write the decision by hand: add `"quarantined": true` (hold it) or
  `"quarantined": false` (you have vetted it) to that server's entry.

Adding the key by hand is enough — the gate obeys an explicit value either way.

### Tool Discovery and Search Isolation

**Quarantined servers are completely isolated from the tool discovery and search system:**

| Feature | Quarantined Server | Approved Server |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Tools indexed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Tools searchable via `retrieve_tools` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Tools appear in HTTP API search | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Tool calls allowed | ❌ No (returns security analysis) | ✅ Yes |

This isolation prevents Tool Poisoning Attacks from:
- **Injecting malicious descriptions** into search results that AI agents might read and follow
- **Appearing in tool recommendations** where they could be mistakenly selected
- **Influencing AI agent behavior** through carefully crafted tool metadata

When a server is quarantined:
1. Its tools are **immediately removed** from the search index
2. `retrieve_tools` queries will **never return** tools from that server
3. The server remains visible in the server list (marked as quarantined) for management

When a server is unquarantined (approved):
1. The server connects to discover its tools
2. Tools are **indexed and become searchable**
3. Tool calls are allowed to execute normally
4. Any **pending** (newly-discovered, never-reviewed) tool-approval records for
   the server are **auto-promoted to approved** — approving a server means you
   trust its current tool snapshot (baseline trust). Tools whose description or
   schema later **changes** (`changed`, i.e. rug-pull) are *not* affected and
   stay blocked until you re-approve them explicitly.

### Security Analysis

When a tool from a quarantined server is called, MCPProxy **blocks the call** and
returns a structured security response instead of invoking it — so the tool's
description can be reviewed before it ever runs:

```json
{
  "status": "QUARANTINED_SERVER_BLOCKED",
  "serverName": "suspicious-server",
  "toolName": "fetch_data",
  "message": "🔒 SECURITY BLOCK: Server 'suspicious-server' is currently in quarantine for security review. Tool calls are blocked to prevent potential Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPAs).",
  "instructions": "To use tools from this server, please: 1) Review the server and its tools for malicious content, 2) Use the 'upstream_servers' tool with operation 'list_quarantined' to inspect tools, 3) remove from quarantine if verified safe",
  "toolAnalysis": {
    "name": "fetch_data",
    "description": "…",
    "inputSchema": { "…": "…" },
    "serverName": "suspicious-server",
    "analysis": "SECURITY ANALYSIS: This tool is from a quarantined server. Please carefully review the description and input schema for potential hidden instructions, embedded prompts, or suspicious behavior patterns."
  }
}
```

The actual pattern **detection** — hidden-Unicode smuggling, cross-server
shadowing, decoded shell payloads, injection/exfiltration phrases, and embedded
secrets — is performed by the deterministic offline detect engine that backs the
built-in `tpa-descriptions` scanner. Its findings appear in the scan report
(`mcpproxy security report <server>`), each carrying a `rule_id`, `severity`,
`threat_level`, `confidence`, and the contributing check `signals`. See
[Tool Scanner](/features/tool-scanner) for the full rule reference.

## Prompt rug-pull baseline (spec 100)

When upstream **prompt aggregation** is enabled (`aggregate_upstream_prompts: true`, off by default), mcpproxy keeps a per-prompt approval baseline that mirrors the tool rug-pull machinery. A trusted server that ships a benign prompt and later mutates its **advertised metadata** (name, description, or argument descriptions) has that changed prompt **withheld from `prompts/list`** until it is approved — closing the gap where a subtler injection that passes the poison scanner could still slip in via a later edit.

- **Scope — metadata only.** The baseline hashes the prompt's advertised metadata, not its `prompts/get` message content (which is materialised fresh per call and has no list-time artifact to baseline). Content is defended separately by output sanitisation and size caps. This is an inherent limit, not a shortcut.
- **Enforcement is by withholding.** A held prompt is simply not registered, so it is absent from `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` on it fails natively. There is no separate runtime gate.
- **Trust parity.** A server with `trust_mode: auto` (or `auto_approve_tool_changes: true`) auto-approves its prompt changes; `manual` holds them. Disabling quarantine globally (`quarantine_enabled: false`) auto-approves.

Manage held prompts with the `quarantine_security` MCP tool:

```jsonc
// see what is held (all servers, or one via "name")
{ "operation": "inspect_prompts", "name": "github" }
// approve one held prompt, or all for a server
{ "operation": "approve_prompt", "name": "github", "prompt_name": "summarize_pr" }
{ "operation": "approve_all_prompts", "name": "github" }
```

## Managing Quarantine

### Scan a Server for TPAs (MCP)

The `quarantine_security` tool can also run and read the TPA scan, so an agent
reviewing a held server does not have to leave for the CLI or web UI:

```jsonc
// run the offline baseline scan (in-process, no Docker required)
{ "operation": "scan_server", "name": "github" }
// read the latest verdict + findings
{ "operation": "get_scan_report", "name": "github" }
```

`scan_server` answers with the verdict when the scan settles quickly, otherwise
with the job id and `"status": "scan started"` — poll `get_scan_report` for the
result. Every `list_quarantined`, `inspect_quarantined` and `inspect_tools`
response also carries a one-line `scan_status`, so a server nobody ever scanned
reads as `never scanned — run scan_server first` instead of looking clean.

The optional Docker-based deep scanners are a separate layer: they run only when
[deep scan](/features/security-scanner-plugins) is enabled, and when they are
unavailable they are skipped without changing the baseline verdict.

### View Quarantined Servers

**Web UI:**
1. Open the dashboard
2. Go to **Servers** and select the **Quarantined** filter tab
3. Review pending servers

**CLI:**
```bash
mcpproxy upstream list
# Shows quarantine status for each server
```

### Approve a Server

**Web UI:**
1. Click on the quarantined server
2. Review the security analysis
3. Click "Approve" to remove from quarantine

**API:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/servers/server-name/unquarantine
```

**Config File:**

Edit `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json` and add `"quarantined": false`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "reviewed-server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@example/mcp-server"],
      "quarantined": false,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Re-quarantine a Server

If you need to quarantine a previously approved server:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/servers/server-name/quarantine
```

## Security Checklist

Before approving a server, verify:

- [ ] **Source**: Is the server from a trusted source?
- [ ] **Code Review**: Have you reviewed the server's code?
- [ ] **Tool Descriptions**: Do tool descriptions look legitimate?
- [ ] **Network Access**: Does the server need network access?
- [ ] **Permissions**: Are requested permissions appropriate?

## Detection Patterns

Tool-description analysis is performed by the deterministic, fully-offline
**detect engine** that backs the built-in `tpa-descriptions` scanner. It runs
**seven checks across two tiers** — four **hard** checks that auto-quarantine and
block approval, and three **soft** checks that raise a human-review item:

| Check | Tier | Catches |
|-------|------|---------|
| `unicode.hidden` | hard | Zero-width / bidi / TAG-block / PUA character smuggling |
| `shadowing.cross_server` | hard | Impersonation clone (same name + near-duplicate description on another server) or exclusive cross-server reference |
| `payload.decoded` | hard | base64/hex blob that decodes to a shell/exfil command |
| `phrase.injection` | hard | Curated instruction-override / exfiltration directives |
| `directive.imperative` | soft | Injection directives, secrecy imperatives, instruction overrides |
| `capability.mismatch` | soft | Compute/string tool touching `~/.ssh` etc.; unexplained data-sink param |
| `secret.embedded` | soft | Hardcoded live credential (confidence-scored, placeholders dropped) |

Each check is deterministic and reliability is enforced by a CI eval gate. See
[Tool Scanner](/features/tool-scanner) for the full rule reference, the two-tier
model, normalization, and the eval gate.

## Best Practices

1. **Review All Servers**: Never auto-approve servers added by AI agents
2. **Source Verification**: Only approve servers from known, trusted sources
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Prefer servers with limited, specific capabilities
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review approved servers
5. **Network Isolation**: Use Docker isolation with `network_mode: "none"` for untrusted servers

## Tool-Level Quarantine

In addition to server-level quarantine, MCPProxy provides **tool-level quarantine** that detects changes to individual tool descriptions and schemas using SHA256 hashing. This protects against "rug pull" attacks where a previously trusted server silently modifies tool behavior.

See [Tool Quarantine](./tool-quarantine.md) for complete documentation on:
- SHA256 hash-based tool approval
- CLI commands: `mcpproxy upstream inspect` and `mcpproxy upstream approve`
- Configuration: `quarantine_enabled` (global) and `auto_approve_tool_changes` (per-server; deprecates `skip_quarantine`)
- REST API endpoints for tool approval management

### Trust modes (auto | scan | manual)

Since spec 086, each server carries a **trust mode** that governs both
new-server admission and tool-change approval (superseding the binary
`auto_approve_tool_changes` flag, which is migrated onto it automatically):

| Mode | Add time | Tool changes |
|------|----------|--------------|
| `auto` | Admitted without quarantine or scanning | Trusted without scanning (rug-pull risk) |
| `scan` | Quarantined, then a fail-closed automatic TPA scan admits it on a clean verdict | Auto-approved only when the offline scan verdict is clean; otherwise held for review |
| `manual` (default) | Quarantined for human review | Every change held for review |

Config field: per-server `trust_mode`; REST: `trust_mode` on
`POST/PATCH/GET /api/v1/servers`; CLI: `mcpproxy upstream add --trust-mode`.

**Unrecognized values are rejected, not guessed.** The values are
case-sensitive (`Scan` is not `scan`). A bogus value is refused with a `400`
naming the accepted vocabulary on `POST`/`PATCH /api/v1/servers`, by the
`upstream_servers` MCP tool, and by `--trust-mode` / `upstream add-json` —
every seam where a value is being *written*.

**Loading is different: it normalizes instead of failing.** A bogus
`trust_mode` already sitting in `mcp_config.json` (older releases persisted
whatever the API was handed) is rewritten to `manual` at load time with a
`WARN` on stderr naming the server and the offending value. This is the tier
the runtime already applied to it, so nothing about the decision changes — but
the daemon still starts and hot-reloads instead of refusing to boot on a file
it cannot fix itself. `POST /api/v1/config/apply` normalizes the same way, so
a full-config apply is never blocked by a legacy value it did not introduce.
Should an unvalidated value ever reach the runtime anyway, resolution still
fails closed to `manual`.

### Automatic informational baseline scan

Independently of `trust_mode`, MCPProxy runs the free in-process Pass-1 TPA scan
so every server ends up with a security verdict instead of an empty badge:

- **On admission** — a newly added, enabled server gets one baseline scan. Servers
  with `trust_mode: "scan"` are skipped entirely: that mode's own admission gate
  scans them, and routing an informational verdict into its settle-driven
  auto-approval could change quarantine state.
- **Once per installation** — a background sweep at startup scans enabled servers
  that have never been scanned (for installs that predate this behaviour). It is
  serialized, never delays startup, is cancelled on shutdown, and a persisted
  marker keeps it one-shot.

These scans are **informational**: the verdict fills in the scan summary and the
UI badge and never quarantines, approves, or blocks anything. Disable with
`security.auto_baseline_scan: false` (env: `MCPPROXY_AUTO_BASELINE_SCAN`).
The `trust_mode: "scan"` gate above is a separate path and is unaffected.

### Signature bundle (offline TPA corpus)

The `scan` mode runs an offline TPA signature corpus (the tpa-db
`scanner-bundle.json`). By default it is the corpus embedded in the build; set
`security.tpa_bundle_path` in `mcp_config.json` (env override:
`MCPPROXY_TPA_BUNDLE_PATH`, which wins over the file value on every path —
loader, hot-reload, `/api/v1/config/apply`) to run a corpus from disk instead.
The path is re-read on config hot-reload, so refreshing signatures needs no
restart, and it is honoured in **every transport**, stdio included.

A configured bundle that cannot be read, parsed, version-checked, or compiled
is **refused**: the previously active corpus stays live (fail-closed, never
fail-empty) and the reason is logged and reported as `load_error` below.
A bundle that parses but contributes **zero runnable rules** — an empty
`rules` array, or rules that are all non-runnable offline — counts as a load
failure for exactly the same reason: an empty corpus would leave the `scan`
gate reporting full coverage while nothing at all was being matched.

Which corpus is live is visible in:

- `mcpproxy security overview` — source, version, freshness stamp, fingerprint,
  and the runnable / skipped / declared-skipped rule split;
- `GET /api/v1/security/overview` → `signature_bundle`;
- the Web UI **Security** tab ("Signatures (runnable)" stat).

The "Add time" column applies to every admission path — the `upstream_servers`
tool, the REST API, a registry add, and (since issue #937) a first-seen server
in `mcp_config.json`. See
[Servers added by hand-editing `mcp_config.json`](#servers-added-by-hand-editing-mcp_configjson).

**Web UI (spec 088)**: the server's Configuration tab has a tri-mode
selector (choosing `auto` asks for confirmation and explains the risk); the
add-server form chooses the mode instead of a raw quarantine checkbox
(initial quarantine is derived from the mode); server tiles show a
trust-mode badge.

### Hold evidence in the Web UI (spec 088)

When the `scan` gate holds a tool, the approval record carries evidence —
`held_reason` (`scan_findings` = the scan found threats vs `scan_coverage`
= the scan could not complete, held as a precaution), `held_verdict`, and
`held_signals` (matched check ids, with known-attack `TPA-YYYY-NNNN`
signature ids listed first). The Web UI renders this on the tool-quarantine
panel, the change-diff dialog, and the global Tools page, with a best-effort
link into the server's latest scan report highlighting matching findings.
The quarantine banner distinguishes four states: scan running, scan verdict
blocked automatic approval, scan could not complete (retry offered), and
awaiting manual review.

### Block (approve + disable)

When reviewing a pending or changed tool you may want to **acknowledge it but
keep it hidden** from MCP clients — for example, dismissing a noisy "changed"
flag for a tool you never intend to use. The **block** operation does this
atomically: it approves the tool (clearing the quarantine flag) **and** disables
it in a single, all-or-nothing server-side write, so a tool is never left in the
approved+enabled state.

- **REST**: `POST /api/v1/servers/{id}/tools/block` with `{"tools":[...]}` or
  `{"block_all": true}`.
- **MCP**: `quarantine_security` operations `block_tool` (with `name` +
  `tool_name`) and `block_all_tools` (with `name`).

A blocked tool can be re-exposed later with the normal enable operation
(`POST /api/v1/servers/{id}/tools/{tool}/enabled` with `{"enabled": true}`).

### Namespaced tool names

A tool's identity is the exact name its server reports in `tools/list`, colons
included. `erase` and `ns:erase` on the same server are two tools, and each has
its own approval record, index entry and callability — a record for `erase`
never approves `ns:erase`, and vice versa. Every gate (dispatch through
`call_tool_*`, direct-name dispatch on `/mcp/all`, `call_tool()` inside code
execution, preflight and `describe_tool`) looks the record up under the exact
name it will dispatch.

Releases before this rule filed a colon-named tool under the text after its
first colon, so `ns:erase` shared the record `erase`. On the first discovery
after upgrading, a server that has a baseline (any approved tool) and serves
colon-named tools therefore sees those tools **become pending once, under
their own names** on `manual` and `scan` trust — review them with
`mcpproxy upstream inspect <server>` and approve them with
`mcpproxy upstream approve <server> <tool>`, the `quarantine_security` MCP
tool, or the Web UI. `trust_mode: auto` servers (and installs with
`quarantine_enabled: false`) auto-approve them. Nothing is deleted: the old
collapsed record stays with the bare name it stores.

Two things about the old record carry over so an upgrade never silently
widens access:

- A **user block** (a `Disabled` toggle, `disable_all`, `block_all`) on the
  collapsed record is copied onto the namespaced tool's new record, and the
  log says so at `WARN` naming both keys. The namespaced tool stays hidden
  until you enable it under its own name — a tool you had blocked before the
  upgrade is still blocked after it. A **quarantine lock** (`pending` /
  `changed`) on the collapsed record is adopted onto the new record *with its
  evidence* (the before/after definition of a rug pull, the scan verdict of
  a held tool) on `manual` and `scan` trust — including the first discovery
  of a server that has no baseline yet, where a brand-new tool would be
  auto-baselined: a tool the old release held for review stays held until
  you approve it by its own name, and the review shows what the old release
  had flagged rather than "new tool". The lock is never turned into a block:
  approving the tool by its name is all it takes (no second enable toggle).
  Under `trust_mode: auto` or `quarantine_enabled: false` the old lock never
  bound and the tool auto-approves as before.
- A namespaced tool you had **toggled** in the UI before the upgrade already
  has a record under its exact name — one that the toggle created without an
  approved contract hash. Such a record carries no approval decision of its
  own, so on the first discovery after upgrade it takes its decision from the
  collapsed record: a `pending` / `changed` lock there (with its before/after
  evidence) is adopted and the tool stays held for review under its own name;
  an approval there counts only if the definition it approved is the one the
  server reports now — then the exact record is baselined and change
  detection works from then on — while a differing definition is held as
  `changed` with the approved one as the before-evidence, exactly as the
  collapsed record itself would have been (a tool that changed while it had
  no live baseline is a potential rug pull, not a new baseline). A user
  block on the collapsed record rides along on every one of those outcomes.
  With no collapsed record at all the tool is pending under its own name on
  `manual` and `scan` trust (a green scan approves it on `scan`), and
  baselined on `trust_mode: auto` or with `quarantine_enabled: false`.
  Nothing you toggled is ever approved for a definition nobody reviewed.

The same rule now applies to the toggle itself: disabling or re-enabling a
tool that has **no approval record yet** (a tool discovery listed but never
filed) creates a `pending` record while the quarantine gate is active for its
server — the toggle records visibility, it does not approve — so a disable →
enable round trip leaves the tool pending until you approve it by name.
Under `trust_mode: auto` or `quarantine_enabled: false` the record is
approved and baselined to the definition the server currently reports.

Only records written by an older release are consulted this way. Every record
this release writes is stamped as identity-keyed, and the first discovery pass
after upgrade stamps every remaining record the server holds — including
collapsed records for tools the server no longer lists — so the migration
runs exactly once per server: a genuine sibling `erase` you disable later
never affects a new `v2:erase`. The one exception is an old record that still
*restricts* — user-disabled, `pending` or `changed` — for a tool the pass did
not list (the tool was not served on the first pass after upgrade, or an
authoritative empty refresh dropped it). Such a record is a decision you or
the old release made about a tool that is merely absent, so it is left
unstamped and waits: when the tool reappears, the pass that files its exact
record consults the old record once — the block or lock carries over exactly
as above — and stamps it then.

## Disabling Quarantine

**Not recommended**, but you can opt out of quarantine globally by setting a
single top-level flag in `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "quarantine_enabled": false
}
```

When `quarantine_enabled` is `false`:

- Servers added dynamically via the `upstream_servers` MCP tool or the
  `POST /api/v1/servers` REST endpoint default to **not quarantined**.
- Tool-level quarantine (per-tool SHA-256 approval of descriptions and
  schemas, see [Tool Quarantine](./tool-quarantine.md)) is skipped.

An explicit `quarantined` field in an add-server request still wins over
the default, so client code can always override on a per-server basis.
Per-server `auto_approve_tool_changes: true` auto-approves all post-baseline tool changes and additions for that server (the deprecated `skip_quarantine: true` is migrated onto it automatically).

Warning: Disabling quarantine exposes your system to Tool Poisoning
Attacks. Only do this on machines where every MCP server you connect to
is already trusted.
