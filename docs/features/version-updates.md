# Version Updates

MCPProxy includes built-in update checking to help you stay current with the latest features and security fixes.

:::tip Installing the update
This page covers how MCPProxy *notices* a new version. For actually applying
one — the macOS one-click updater, `mcpproxy update`, the per-channel behaviour
matrix and the kill switches — see [Auto-Update](/features/auto-update).
:::

## How It Works

MCPProxy automatically checks for new versions by querying GitHub Releases:

1. **Background checking**: The core server checks for updates on startup and every 4 hours thereafter
2. **Non-blocking**: Update checks run in the background and don't affect proxy performance
3. **Graceful degradation**: If the check fails (e.g., no internet), MCPProxy continues working normally

## Where Updates Are Displayed

### System Tray

When an update is available, a new menu item appears in the tray menu:

- **"New version available (vX.Y.Z)"** - Click to open the GitHub releases page
- For Homebrew users: **"Update available: vX.Y.Z (use brew upgrade)"**

The menu item only appears when an update is detected - no menu clutter when you're up to date.

### Web Control Panel

The sidebar displays the current version at the bottom. When an update is available:

- A small "update available" badge appears next to the version
- Click to view the release notes

The dashboard additionally shows a **dismissible update banner** ("Update
available: vX — you are running vY") with a release-notes link. Dismissal is
**per version**: dismissing the banner for v1.3.0 keeps it hidden for v1.3.0
(persisted in the browser), but the banner reappears when a newer release
becomes available. The banner is non-modal and never blocks the UI.

### CLI Doctor Command

The `mcpproxy doctor` command shows version information:

```bash
$ mcpproxy doctor
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 MCPProxy Health Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Version: v1.2.3 (update available: v1.3.0, 8 releases / ~14 weeks behind)
Download: https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/tag/v1.3.0

✅ All systems operational! No issues detected.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Configuration

### Config File (`update_check`)

Update checking is controlled from `mcp_config.json` via the `update_check`
block:

```json
{
  "update_check": {
    "enabled": true,
    "channel": "stable"
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch. When `false`, no network check is performed (background poll and the manual re-check) and no upgrade nudge appears on any surface — the `update` object is omitted from `/api/v1/info`. |
| `channel` | string | `"stable"` | Release channel: `"stable"` (GitHub `releases/latest`; prereleases never offered) or `"rc"` (prerelease tags such as `v0.47.0-rc.1` included). |

Both keys are **hot-reloadable**: editing the config file or applying it via
`POST /api/v1/config/apply` takes effect without a restart. Re-enabling (or
switching channels) triggers a prompt re-check instead of waiting for the next
4-hour tick.

`enabled: false` also gates the Go tray's built-in daily self-update check, so
no surface performs a network check while disabled. The tray does **not** read
`mcp_config.json` itself (it holds no state); instead it asks the core via
`GET /api/v1/info` before checking — the core omits the `update` object when
update checking is disabled, and the tray then skips its own network check. If
the core is unreachable the tray skips that tick and retries, rather than
falling open to a check the operator may have disabled. The tray's own check
still selects prereleases via `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES` only —
converging it fully onto the shared checker (including `channel`) is a separate
Spec 079 work item (FR-001a).

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE` | Disable background update checks entirely | `false` |
| `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES` | Include prerelease/beta versions in update checks | `false` |

### Precedence (env vs config)

The environment switches **win over** the `update_check` config keys — they
are the operator override:

- `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true` disables checking even when
  `update_check.enabled` is `true`.
- `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES=true` selects the prerelease channel — but
  see the build-identity rule below: it only takes effect on dev/unstamped
  builds.

The env vars only widen in one direction (disable checks / include
prereleases). They cannot re-enable checking that the config disabled: with
`update_check.enabled: false`, no check runs regardless of environment.

### The running build's version decides the channel

For a **released** build the running binary's own version is authoritative and
overrides both `update_check.channel` and `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES`:

- a **stable** build (e.g. `v0.56.0`) is **never** offered an RC — a stale `rc`
  opt-in left over from a previously-installed RC cannot resurrect RC offers;
- an **RC** build (`-rc.N` / `-next.*`) tracks the **rc** channel automatically
  (offered the next RC, and its graduating stable) with no opt-in;
- a **dev / unstamped** build (local `go build`, a `go install @commit`
  pseudo-version) has no release identity, so the `channel` config key and
  `MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES` still apply — the only way to exercise the
  rc channel without a released RC binary.

The macOS tray applies the same rule to itself: a stable tray app never offers
itself an RC even when attached to a newer RC core. See
[Prerelease Builds](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/blob/main/docs/prerelease-builds.md).

### Examples

```bash
# Disable update checking (config file — persistent, hot-reloads)
#   "update_check": { "enabled": false }

# Disable update checking (environment — wins over config)
MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true mcpproxy serve

# Opt in to prerelease (RC) updates via config
#   "update_check": { "channel": "rc" }

# Enable prerelease updates via environment (for beta testers)
MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES=true mcpproxy serve
```

## API Endpoint

Update information is available via the REST API:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-key" http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/info
```

Response includes an `update` field when version information is available:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "version": "v1.2.3",
    "update": {
      "available": true,
      "latest_version": "v1.3.0",
      "behind_summary": "8 releases / ~14 weeks behind",
      "releases_behind": 8,
      "weeks_behind": 14,
      "release_url": "https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/tag/v1.3.0",
      "checked_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "is_prerelease": false,
      "install_channel": "homebrew",
      "update_command": "brew upgrade mcpproxy"
    }
  }
}
```

## How the Install Channel Is Detected

MCPProxy identifies how it was installed so it can show the right update
instruction for your setup (`install_channel` in `/api/v1/info`, plus the
guided command in `mcpproxy status`, `mcpproxy doctor`, and the Web UI
banner).

Detection prefers a **build-time channel marker** stamped into
single-channel artifacts at packaging time (the Docker image, the Windows
installer, and — since Spec 092 — the release `.tar.gz`/`.zip` archives).
When no marker is present, runtime heuristics run in decreasing confidence
order:

1. **Homebrew**: the (symlink-resolved) executable path lives under a
   Homebrew prefix (`/opt/homebrew/`, a `Cellar/` path, or
   `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`).
2. **Docker**: `/.dockerenv` exists.
3. **deb / rpm**: on Linux, the executable is exactly `/usr/bin/mcpproxy`,
   the owning package manager confirms it owns the file
   (`/var/lib/dpkg/info/mcpproxy.list` for deb; for rpm, an rpm database
   exists **and** a one-shot `rpm -qf /usr/bin/mcpproxy` query names the
   `mcpproxy` package), **and** the MCPProxy repository is configured
   (`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mcpproxy.list` resp.
   `/etc/yum.repos.d/mcpproxy.repo`, as written by the documented setup).
   The repo signal matters because the apt/dnf commands only work against
   `apt.mcpproxy.app` / `rpm.mcpproxy.app`: a standalone `.deb`/`.rpm`
   downloaded from a GitHub release is dpkg/rpm-owned but has no upgrade
   candidate, so it stays `unknown` and gets release-page guidance. A binary
   merely copied to `/usr/bin` (e.g. an AUR or manual install) also stays
   `unknown`.
4. **DMG**: on macOS, the executable runs from an `.app/Contents/MacOS` or
   `.app/Contents/Resources/bin` bundle path, or is the tray-staged core at
   `~/Library/Application Support/mcpproxy/bin/mcpproxy` (the process that
   actually serves the API for DMG installs; only the tray's bundle-staging
   writes that directory).
5. **go install**: the Go toolchain stamped a real module version into the
   binary's build info while no release version was stamped via ldflags.
   For this channel the checker also adopts that module version as its
   current version (the ldflags default would read "development" and
   disable update checks entirely).
6. Otherwise the channel is **`unknown`**.

Ambiguity always resolves to `unknown`: MCPProxy never guesses a channel,
because a wrong update command is worse than a generic instruction.

### Why the `tarball` marker is weak

The `tarball` marker is the one exception to "the marker wins". Homebrew
installs the *same* release `.tar.gz` into its Cellar, so a stamped binary can
legitimately end up in a Homebrew (or, after a future packaging change, some
other) install. The detector therefore runs heuristics 1–5 first and only
applies a `tarball` marker when none of them matched — that is, when the
binary is an official release archive extracted somewhere no package manager
owns. Every other marker (docker, windows-installer, …) still short-circuits
detection.

This is what makes `tarball` a *positive* identification: `mcpproxy update`
self-replaces the binary only on this channel (Spec 092 FR-020). A plain
`unknown` install is never self-updated, no matter how writable it is —
writability is not ownership.

### Update Commands per Channel

| Channel | `update_command` | Guidance shown instead |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| `homebrew` | `brew upgrade mcpproxy` | — |
| `deb` | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install --only-upgrade mcpproxy` | — |
| `rpm` | `sudo dnf upgrade mcpproxy` | — |
| `go-install` | `go install github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/cmd/mcpproxy@latest` | — |
| `dmg` | — | Download the latest DMG (release page is deep-linked) |
| `windows-installer` | — | Download the latest Windows installer |
| `docker` | — | Pull or rebuild the newer image for your deployment |
| `tarball` | `mcpproxy update` | — |
| `unknown` | — | Download the latest release from the releases page |

Every surface always deep-links the release notes for the latest version,
whether or not a command is available.

**Prerelease targets** (the `rc` channel or
`MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES=true`) are the exception: prereleases are
published only to the GitHub pre-release channel, so the package-manager
commands above would not deliver them (`brew`/`apt`/`dnf` serve stable
artifacts, and Go's `@latest` resolves to the newest stable). When the offered
version is a prerelease, only `go-install` (pinned to the exact version,
`…/cmd/mcpproxy@v0.48.0-rc.1`) and `tarball` (`mcpproxy update`, which resolves
releases through the same prerelease selection) keep a command — every other
channel falls back to the release-page guidance.

## Updating MCPProxy

### `mcpproxy update` (all channels)

`mcpproxy update` branches on the detected install channel (Spec 092 US3) so
you never have to remember which one you are on:

| Channel | What the command does |
|---------|----------------------|
| `homebrew` / `deb` / `rpm` / `go-install` | Prints the exact upgrade command and exits. Nothing is modified — the package manager owns the install. |
| `docker` / `windows-installer` | Prints channel-appropriate guidance. |
| `dmg` (macOS app bundle) | Points at the menu bar app (MCPProxy menu → Check for Updates). The app bundle and its staged core copy are never modified. |
| `tarball` | Performs a verified self-update (see below). |
| `unknown` | Guidance only. Pass `--self` to assert that you manage the binary yourself; writability alone is not ownership. |

```bash
mcpproxy update --check                     # current / latest / channel, no side effects
mcpproxy update                             # do the right thing for this install
mcpproxy update -o json                     # machine-readable report
mcpproxy update --self                      # assert a self-managed install on `unknown`
mcpproxy update --version v0.54.0 --force   # deliberate downgrade (both flags required)
```

**Self-update safety rules** (FR-021/FR-022):

- The release archive's SHA-256 is always checked against the release's
  `checksums.txt`, and `checksums.txt` itself is verified against its cosign
  signature bundle with the signing identity pinned to this repository's
  release workflow. Verification currently shells out to a locally installed
  [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/); if cosign is not on
  `PATH` the update **aborts** — `--allow-unverified-signature` is the explicit
  (and loudly warned) opt-out that falls back to checksum-only verification.
- The swap is a rename inside the target directory, the file mode is
  preserved, and a symlinked launcher has its destination replaced rather than
  the symlink.
- The previous binary is kept as `<binary>.old` until the new one runs and
  reports the expected version; on any failure it is restored.
- A non-writable target fails with a message naming the path and its owner.
  MCPProxy never escalates privileges.
- A version equal to or older than the running one requires **both**
  `--version <tag>` and `--force`.
- An already-running core keeps executing the old binary; the swap takes
  effect the next time it starts.

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew upgrade mcpproxy
```

### Manual Download

1. Click the update notification in the tray menu or web UI
2. Download the appropriate binary for your platform
3. Replace the existing binary and restart MCPProxy

### Windows Installer

Download the latest `.msi` installer from GitHub Releases and run it. The installer will upgrade your existing installation.

## Development Builds

When running a development build (version shows as "development"), update checking is automatically disabled since there's no meaningful version to compare against.

## Troubleshooting

### Update check not working

1. Ensure you have internet connectivity
2. Check if `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE` is set, or `update_check.enabled` is `false` in `mcp_config.json`
3. Run `mcpproxy doctor` to see current version status
4. Check logs for any GitHub API errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.mcpproxy/logs/main.log | grep -i update
   ```

### Prerelease not showing

By default, prerelease versions are excluded. To enable, set
`"update_check": { "channel": "rc" }` in `mcp_config.json`, or:

```bash
export MCPPROXY_ALLOW_PRERELEASE_UPDATES=true
```

### Behind corporate firewall

MCPProxy checks updates via `https://api.github.com`. Ensure this domain is accessible from your network.
