# Upstream Servers

MCPProxy can connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously, providing unified access through a single endpoint.

## Server Types

MCPProxy supports three types of upstream connections:

### stdio Servers

Local servers that communicate via standard input/output:

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user/projects"],
  "protocol": "stdio",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### HTTP Servers

Remote servers accessible via HTTP/HTTPS:

```json
{
  "name": "remote-server",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
  "protocol": "http",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### OAuth Servers

Servers requiring OAuth 2.1 authentication:

```json
{
  "name": "github-server",
  "url": "https://api.github.com/mcp",
  "protocol": "http",
  "oauth": {
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "scopes": ["repo", "user"]
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

#### Pinning the callback port with `redirect_uri`

By default mcpproxy asks the OS for a free loopback port on the first OAuth
login, then persists that port and reuses it. If the saved port is taken next
time, a different one is allocated — so the callback URL is not guaranteed to
stay put.

Some providers require the port to match the registered callback URL exactly.
GitHub OAuth Apps are the common case: even with GitHub's wildcard matching
enabled, that matching covers subdomains and subdirectory paths — the host and
port must still match exactly. Set `redirect_uri` to pin it:

```json
{
  "oauth": {
    "client_id": "Iv1.abc123",
    "redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:54108/oauth/callback"
  }
}
```

mcpproxy binds that exact port and path and sends that exact string to the
provider. Register the identical URL with the provider.

The value must be an RFC 8252 loopback redirect: `http` scheme, a loopback host,
and an explicit port. The path can be anything — some providers publish a
single shared OAuth application with a fixed callback path an operator cannot
change (e.g. `http://localhost:18080/callback`), and mcpproxy's own callback
path is just an implementation detail, so it binds its listener to whatever
path the pin specifies. A pin with no path at all binds `/`; `/oauth/callback`
is only the default when `redirect_uri` is omitted entirely and mcpproxy
allocates a dynamic port. Prefer `127.0.0.1`;
`localhost` is accepted but the listener binds `127.0.0.1`, while
`http://[::1]:PORT/oauth/callback` binds the IPv6 loopback.

A malformed value, or a pinned port already in use, fails the login with an
error that names `oauth.redirect_uri` — in the connection error and the
server's `health.detail`, in `mcpproxy upstream logs <name>`, and in the main
log. The write surfaces (REST config API, Web UI, the `upstream_servers` MCP
tool) reject a bad value up front; hand-editing `mcp_config.json` bypasses that
by design, so a bad value already on disk is reported at connect time rather
than stopping the daemon from booting.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the server |
| `command` | string | For stdio | Command to execute |
| `args` | array | No | Command arguments |
| `url` | string | For HTTP | Server URL |
| `protocol` | string | Yes | `stdio` or `http` |
| `enabled` | boolean | No | Whether server is active (default: true) |
| `working_dir` | string | No | Working directory for stdio servers |
| `env` | object | No | Environment variables to pass |
| `oauth` | object | No | OAuth configuration |
| `auth_broker` | object | No | Server-edition per-user `oauth_connect` credential store — the stored credential is **not** injected into upstream calls. See [Auth Broker](../features/auth-broker.md). `mode` must be `oauth_connect`; `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint` are required. |
| `health_check_interval` | duration | No | Per-server override for the liveness `ping` cadence (`0s` disables; falls back to the global value, then the `30s` default). No-op for Docker-isolated servers. |
| `tool_discovery_interval` | duration | No | Per-server override for the `tools/list` re-index sweep (`0s` disables; falls back to the global value, then the `5m` default). |

See [Tool Discovery & Health Check Intervals](/configuration/config-file#tool-discovery--health-check-intervals) for the global defaults, accepted ranges, and trade-offs.

## Headers, Environment Variables, and Secrets

Both HTTP `headers` and stdio `env` are first-class config fields you can
inspect and edit from the Web UI, the macOS tray, the CLI, and the REST
API. The wire format and semantics are identical across surfaces.

### How the API displays them

The REST API (`GET /api/v1/servers`), the SSE `servers.changed` event, and
the MCP `upstream_servers list` tool all redact sensitive header values
by default. The mask format is:

```
••••<last2> (<N> chars)
```

…e.g. a 71-character Bearer token whose last two characters are `59`
appears on the wire as `••••59 (71 chars)`. The mask preserves enough
context to identify which token is in use without leaking the secret.

Values that are already secret **references** — `${keyring:NAME}` or
`${env:VAR}` — pass through unchanged: they're labels, not secrets.

This redaction was added in PR #425 to close a real exfiltration path —
a prompt-injected agent calling `upstream_servers list` would otherwise
get back another upstream's Bearer token in plaintext.

To disable redaction (for debugging only), set `reveal_secret_headers: true`
in `mcp_config.json`. **It's not normally needed**: the editing flow
described below works without ever exposing the plaintext to the client.

The flag reveals raw values only to an **authenticated admin**, and only on
the REST and MCP read doors. It never applies to the `/events` SSE stream or
to `upstream_stats`, and `GET /api/v1/config` is denied to agent tokens
outright (issue #1167).

Since v0.64 (issue #1148) the flag additionally requires an **authenticated**
caller. `/mcp` is deliberately unprotected by default
(`require_mcp_auth: false`), so an unauthenticated MCP client is treated as
admin for backward compatibility — but that is not an identity, and it no
longer satisfies a check that hands back raw credentials. With the flag on,
raw values are returned to a caller presenting the API key or an admin agent
token, to a tray/socket connection (authenticated by OS-level socket
permissions), and over stdio; an unauthenticated TCP `/mcp` caller gets the
masked values. Nothing else changes: every other operation an unauthenticated
MCP client can perform today still works.

Argument vectors are masked too: a credential passed as `--api-key sk-…` in
`args` is masked by flag name, by value shape and — since the review round on
the same issue — by URL shape in every spelling (`--flag <url>`, `--flag=<url>`
and a bare positional token all mask `?token=…` and `https://user:pass@host`).

For the **keyed** fields, a masked value echoed back on the write path is
reverted to the stored value rather than persisted over it, and every revert is
**bound to where the value was read from**:

| Field | Bound by |
|-------|----------|
| `env_json` / `headers_json` | the map key |
| `url` | the stored scheme and host:port (per query parameter, and the userinfo username) |
| `oauth_json` → `client_secret`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri` | the field |
| `oauth_json` → `extra_params` | the parameter name |
| `oauth_json` → `scopes`, and any future oauth field | *nothing — **refused**, never reverted* |
| `args_json` | *nothing — an argv mask is **refused**, never reverted* |

A mask that none of those bindings can reach is refused rather than written
through. For `url` that covers a URL whose scheme/host changed and a credential
that does not sit in a query parameter; for `oauth_json` it covers a scope (its
only context is a position in a caller-supplied slice) and any field added to
the oauth block later, which fails closed instead of silently persisting its own
mask.

**`args_json` is different: an echoed mask is rejected with an error, not
restored.** An argv token has no key to bind a secret to — only its index and
its neighbours — and `args_json` replaces the whole vector while the same patch
also chooses `command`. Every candidate binding is therefore caller-controlled:
an index can be picked, a preceding flag copied verbatim, and a byte-identical
argv means nothing once `command` moves from `mcp-foo` to `curl`. Any revert
rule would let a caller relocate a stored credential into a command line of its
own choosing.

So a write whose `args_json` still carries a mask this proxy rendered fails
with:

```
args_json[2] is a redaction placeholder, not an argument value: credential-shaped
argv tokens are masked on read and are never restored on write, because an argv
slot carries no key to bind the secret to. Resend the real value for that
argument, or omit args_json to leave the stored arguments unchanged
```

Do not build a read-modify-write loop that feeds a masked `args` list back in:
**resend the real values**, or omit `args_json` entirely when you are not
changing the arguments (omitting it leaves the stored vector untouched).
Rejecting is deliberate rather than silently keeping the stored vector —
`args_json` replaces the vector, so ignoring it would make the write look
applied when it was not.

The same contract applies on REST. `GET /api/v1/servers` masks `args` and
`oauth.extra_params` with the same rules (they are one shared implementation in
`internal/oauth`, so the two doors cannot drift), and `POST`/`PATCH
/api/v1/servers` refuse an echoed `args` mask with `400` for the same reason the
MCP path does — `args` replaces the vector there too. The `oauth` block is
read-only over REST, so no REST write can echo its mask back.

### How you edit them

#### Web UI / macOS tray

The Server Detail page → Configuration tab has dedicated **Headers** and
**Environment Variables** cards with per-row affordances:

![Headers card on the Web UI](../screenshots/server-detail/web-headers-card.png)

- **Add** — `+ Add header` / `+ Add variable` button at the top.
- **Edit** — pencil icon turns the value cell into an input. Save / Cancel.
- **Delete** — trash icon. Confirms first.
- **Convert to secret** — lock icon. Opens a modal asking for a name,
  then atomically moves the value into the OS keyring and replaces the
  config field with `${keyring:NAME}`.

![Convert-to-secret modal](../screenshots/server-detail/web-convert-modal.png)

The Convert flow works even on masked headers: the backend has the real
value in `mcp_config.json` and never needs the client to send it.

`${keyring:…}` references render as a labeled chip instead of a masked
literal, so converted headers are visually distinct.

#### CLI

```bash
# Upsert one or more headers
mcpproxy upstream patch synapbus --header "X-Trace: on"

# Rotate Authorization in place
mcpproxy upstream patch synapbus --header "Authorization: Bearer new-token"

# Delete one
mcpproxy upstream patch synapbus --header-remove "X-Stale"

# Mix set + delete in a single round-trip
mcpproxy upstream patch synapbus --header "X-New: v" --header-remove "X-Old"

# Env vars (stdio servers)
mcpproxy upstream patch obsidian-pilot --env "LOG_LEVEL=debug"
mcpproxy upstream patch obsidian-pilot --env-remove "OBSOLETE"
```

See [Management Commands](../cli/management-commands.md#patch-headers--env)
for the full flag reference.

#### REST API

`PATCH /api/v1/servers/{name}` follows JSON Merge Patch
([RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396)):

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"headers":{"X-New":"value","X-Stale":null}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/servers/synapbus
```

- non-null string value → upsert
- JSON `null` value → delete
- key absent from body → preserve (this is how the UI sends a diff
  against the masked view without overwriting unchanged values)

A client that sends the **whole** map back is safe too: a value that is exactly
the mask the read path rendered for that key is reverted to the stored secret,
bound to the key it was read from. What cannot be bound to a key is **refused**
with `400` rather than written through — `args`, `oauth.scopes`,
`isolation.extra_args`, a mask moved to a different key, and a URL mask whose
scheme/host changed. Resend the real value, or omit the field.

See [REST API › PATCH](../api/rest-api.md#patch-apiv1serversname) for the
full reference, including the
[`/config-to-secret`](../api/rest-api.md#post-apiv1serversnameconfig-to-secret)
endpoint that backs the "Convert to secret" affordance.

### Secret references

`headers` and `env` values support two reference shapes that get resolved
at request time rather than stored in plaintext:

| Reference | Source | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `${keyring:NAME}` | OS keyring entry called `NAME` | Persists across restarts; managed via the Secrets page or `mcpproxy secrets` CLI |
| `${env:VAR}` | The `VAR` environment variable on the mcpproxy process | Tied to the shell/launcher that started mcpproxy |

When mcpproxy connects to an upstream it substitutes the reference with
the actual secret. The reference itself never reaches the upstream MCP
server. See [Keyring Integration](../features/keyring-integration.md)
for the full secret-storage story.

## Docker Isolation

For enhanced security, stdio servers can run in Docker containers:

```json
{
  "name": "isolated-server",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "some-mcp-server"],
  "protocol": "stdio",
  "isolation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "image": "node:20",
    "network_mode": "bridge"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Memory and CPU limits are configured at the global level in `docker_isolation`, not per-server.

See [Docker Isolation](/features/docker-isolation) for complete documentation.

## Process Lifecycle

### Startup

When MCPProxy starts, it:
1. Loads server configurations from `mcp_config.json`
2. Creates MCP clients for each enabled, non-quarantined server
3. Connects to servers in the background (async)
4. Indexes tools once connections are established

### Shutdown

When MCPProxy stops, it performs graceful shutdown of all subprocesses:

1. **Graceful Close** (10s): Close MCP connection, wait for process to exit
2. **Force Kill** (9s): If still running, SIGTERM → poll → SIGKILL

**Process groups**: Child processes (spawned by npm/npx/uvx) are placed in a process group, ensuring all related processes are terminated together.

See [Shutdown Behavior](/operations/shutdown-behavior) for detailed documentation.

## Quarantine System

New servers added via AI clients are automatically quarantined for security review. See [Security Quarantine](/features/security-quarantine) for details.
