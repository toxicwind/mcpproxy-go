# Installation

MCPProxy can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Choose the installation method that works best for your platform.

## macOS

### Installer DMG (Recommended)

**Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later** (`LSMinimumSystemVersion` in the app
bundle). On anything older the package installs but the app will not launch.

Download `mcpproxy-<version>-darwin-arm64-installer.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or
`-darwin-amd64-installer.dmg` (Intel) from the
[releases page](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases).

**There is nothing to drag.** The disk image contains a `.pkg` installer and a
`README.txt`:

1. Open the DMG and double-click the `.pkg` file.
2. macOS asks for an administrator password — the package installs for all
   users, so this is required.
3. Follow the installer. There are no components to choose.
4. **The installer launches mcpproxy for you** when it finishes — look for the
   icon in your menu bar. If it is not there, open it from Applications.

Both the disk image and the package are signed and notarized by Apple.

#### What the installer puts on your machine

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `/Applications/mcpproxy.app` | The menu-bar app, with the headless core bundled inside it |
| `/usr/local/bin/mcpproxy` | Symlink to the core binary, so `mcpproxy` works in a terminal |
| `~/.mcpproxy/` | Your config, database and search index |
| `~/Library/Logs/mcpproxy/` | Logs (the macOS standard location, not `~/.mcpproxy/`) |
| `~/.mcpproxy/certs/ca.pem` | A local CA certificate, copied to disk only — see below |

The `ca.pem` row is conditional: `postinstall.sh` copies it only when it can
resolve a non-root `$USER` and the build actually bundled a certificate, and it
has no console-user fallback, so the file may simply be absent. Nothing depends
on it — `mcpproxy trust-cert` generates a certificate itself when none exists.

**The installer does not change your system's certificate trust.** The bundled
`ca.pem` exists so that the optional HTTPS mode has a certificate available;
trust is modified only if you later run `mcpproxy trust-cert` yourself, which
defaults to the **System** keychain (`--keychain=system`) and asks for your
password. The default mode is plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1:8080` and needs no
certificate at all.

The installer also removes a stale `LaunchAgent` left behind by pre-0.5x
builds. It does **not** configure auto-start — that is a per-user toggle in the
tray menu ("Launch at Login").

#### Uninstalling

Quit the app first — from the tray menu, or `pkill -x mcpproxy`. Deleting the
bundle does not stop a running process, and the tray is what shuts the core
down cleanly.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Applications/mcpproxy.app /usr/local/bin/mcpproxy
rm -rf ~/.mcpproxy ~/Library/Logs/mcpproxy   # config, database, index and logs
```

If you ran `mcpproxy trust-cert`, remove the certificate as well. It is in the
**System** keychain unless you passed `--keychain=login`: open **Keychain
Access → System → Certificates** and delete the MCPProxy CA.

### Homebrew

Install the full macOS tray app (signed & notarized, bundles the core server):

```bash
brew install --cask smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy/mcpproxy
```

Or install just the headless core CLI (no tray app):

```bash
brew install smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy/mcpproxy
```


## Windows

### Installer (Recommended)

Download the latest Windows installer (`.exe`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases).

The installer will:
- Install MCPProxy to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mcpproxy`
- Add MCPProxy to your system PATH
- Create Start Menu shortcuts

### Manual Installation

1. Download the Windows binary from the releases page
2. Extract to a directory of your choice
3. Add the directory to your PATH

## Linux

### Debian / Ubuntu — apt repository (recommended)

Add the MCPProxy apt repository once; `apt upgrade` handles updates from then on, like any other system package.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://apt.mcpproxy.app/mcpproxy.gpg \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/mcpproxy.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/mcpproxy.gpg] https://apt.mcpproxy.app stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mcpproxy.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mcpproxy
```

Supported architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`. See [Linux Package Repositories](../features/linux-package-repos.md) for details on retention, pinning older versions, mirroring, and troubleshooting.

Repository signing key fingerprint: `3B6F A1AD 5D53 59DA 51F1  8DDC E1B5 9B9B A1CB 8A3B`. You can verify it with `gpg --show-keys` against the public key URL above.

### Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux — dnf repository (recommended)

```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.mcpproxy.app/mcpproxy.repo
sudo dnf install -y mcpproxy
```

Supported architectures: `x86_64`, `aarch64`.

### Arch Linux — AUR (community-maintained)

MCPProxy is available on the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) as [`mcpproxy-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mcpproxy-bin), which installs the official upstream binary plus a hardened systemd unit.

```bash
# With an AUR helper (recommended)
yay -S mcpproxy-bin

# Or manually with makepkg
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mcpproxy-bin.git
cd mcpproxy-bin
makepkg -si
```

The package installs `mcpproxy` to `/usr/bin` and ships a systemd user unit at `/usr/lib/systemd/user/mcpproxy.service`.

Enable it with:
:::note Update cadence

Unlike the apt/dnf repositories above, AUR is community-driven: new versions land via the `mcpproxy-bin` PKGBUILD being bumped, not via a project-controlled mirror. The package is currently kept current by automation in the maintainer's [updater repo](https://github.com/JasonLandbridge/Arch-Linux-AUR-Packages-Updater), so bumps usually appear within a day of a GitHub release. If `yay` reports an old version after a recent release, you can flag the package "out-of-date" on AUR or fall back to the [Tarball install](#tarball-any-distro) below.

:::

### Debian / Ubuntu — direct `.deb` download (fallback)

If the apt repository isn't reachable (air-gapped installs, behind corporate proxies blocking `mcpproxy.app`, etc.), download the `.deb` from the [releases page](https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases) and install it locally.

**One-liner (auto-detects latest version):**

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest \
  | grep -oE '"tag_name": *"v[^"]+"' | sed -E 's/.*"v([^"]+)"/\1/')
ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)   # amd64 or arm64
curl -fLO "https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest/download/mcpproxy_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.deb"
sudo apt install "./mcpproxy_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.deb"
```

**Or pin a specific version:**

```bash
# AMD64 (x86_64)
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/download/v0.24.2/mcpproxy_0.24.2_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./mcpproxy_0.24.2_amd64.deb

# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton, etc.)
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/download/v0.24.2/mcpproxy_0.24.2_arm64.deb
sudo apt install ./mcpproxy_0.24.2_arm64.deb
```

The package installs `mcpproxy` to `/usr/bin`, ships a hardened systemd unit at `/lib/systemd/system/mcpproxy.service`, and creates a dedicated `mcpproxy` system user. The service is **enabled and started automatically** on first install. Subsequent upgrades preserve your config and `try-restart` the unit.

After install:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mcpproxy
sudo journalctl -u mcpproxy -f      # tail logs
sudo nano /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json   # edit config (then restart)
sudo systemctl restart mcpproxy
```

### Migrating from a manually-installed mcpproxy

If you've been running an older mcpproxy from a binary you dropped into `/usr/local/bin/` with a hand-rolled systemd unit (typically running as your own user, with config under `~/.mcpproxy/`), the apt/dnf install is a different layout. The deb/rpm runs as a dedicated `mcpproxy` system user with config in `/etc/mcpproxy/` and state in `/var/lib/mcpproxy/`. Migration takes a couple of minutes; the only tricky bit is preserving paths your existing config references.

```bash
# 0. Stop and back up everything
sudo systemctl stop mcpproxy
sudo cp -a ~/.mcpproxy ~/mcpproxy-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
sudo cp ~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json ~/mcpproxy-config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# 1. Remove the old service + binaries
sudo systemctl disable mcpproxy
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mcpproxy.service \
        /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mcpproxy.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/mcpproxy /usr/local/bin/mcpproxy.pre-deb.bak  # keep one rollback

# 2. Install the deb (follow the "apt repository (recommended)" section above)
#    The service starts immediately on a fresh config — stop it before migrating state.
sudo systemctl stop mcpproxy

# 3. Carry state across. config.db preserves quarantine + tool-approval state;
#    skip this copy if you'd rather start clean and re-approve every tool.
sudo cp ~/.mcpproxy/config.db          /var/lib/mcpproxy/config.db
sudo cp ~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json    /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json
sudo chown -R mcpproxy:mcpproxy /var/lib/mcpproxy
sudo chown root:mcpproxy /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json
sudo chmod 0640 /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json

# 4. Rewrite any home-relative paths inside the migrated config.
#    The new service can't read /home/<you>/ because the unit sets ProtectHome=true.
sudo sed -i.bak \
    -e "s|\"data_dir\": \"$HOME/.mcpproxy\"|\"data_dir\": \"/var/lib/mcpproxy\"|g" \
    /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json
sudo grep -nE "$HOME" /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json   # should print nothing

# 5. If any stdio server uses `docker run`, give the mcpproxy user docker access:
sudo usermod -aG docker mcpproxy

# 6. Start it
sudo systemctl start mcpproxy
sudo systemctl status mcpproxy --no-pager
```

Things to watch for after step 6:

- **Secrets files referenced from the config**: if any of your stdio servers `source` an env file from your home directory (e.g. `set -a; source ~/.mcpproxy/foo.env; ...`), copy that file to `/etc/mcpproxy/` with `root:mcpproxy 0640` ownership and update the path inside `mcp_config.json`. `ProtectHome=true` will otherwise make the file invisible to the service.
- **Custom data_dir or cache paths**: the same `sed` pattern as step 4 — anything under `$HOME` becomes invisible.
- **Snap-installed Docker**: on Ubuntu hosts where Docker came from snap (the default on 24.04), `mcpproxy doctor` will warn about additional one-time host setup (`loginctl enable-linger mcpproxy`, `snap set system homedirs=/var/lib`, and a systemd drop-in). Follow the snippet `doctor` prints, then `sudo systemctl restart mcpproxy`. The error you'd see otherwise is `cannot create XDG_RUNTIME_DIR folder "/run/user/<uid>/snap.docker"`.

Once you've confirmed the new service is healthy (`mcpproxy doctor` reports no issues), you can delete the backups under `~/mcpproxy-backup-*` — but the deb keeps your config intact across future upgrades regardless.

### Network exposure: localhost by default

Both `.deb` and `.rpm` packages ship a default config that binds **only to `127.0.0.1:8080`** — meaning the service is reachable only from the same machine. This is intentional: MCPProxy proxies tools that can read your filesystem, call paid APIs, and execute code, so a wide-open default would be unsafe.

You can confirm the default in the shipped example:

```bash
cat /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json
# {
#   "listen": "127.0.0.1:8080",
#   ...
# }
```

#### Reaching it from another host on your LAN

If you're installing on a server (a homelab box, a VPS, a Raspberry Pi) and you want other machines to connect to it, you need to do **two** things:

1. **Switch the listen address** from `127.0.0.1:8080` to `0.0.0.0:8080` (all interfaces) or to a specific LAN IP.
2. **Set an `api_key`** so the REST API and tray-style endpoints aren't anonymously accessible. MCPProxy auto-generates one on first start if you leave the field empty, but for a network-exposed install you should set it explicitly to a strong random value.

Example:

```bash
# Generate a strong random API key
API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Edit the config
sudo tee /etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json >/dev/null <<EOF
{
  "listen": "0.0.0.0:8080",
  "api_key": "${API_KEY}",
  "data_dir": "/var/lib/mcpproxy",
  "enable_socket": true,
  "enable_web_ui": true,
  "require_mcp_auth": false,
  "mcpServers": []
}
EOF

# Restart so the new bind takes effect
sudo systemctl restart mcpproxy

# From another machine on the LAN:
curl -H "X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}" http://<server-ip>:8080/api/v1/status
```

:::caution Security checklist before exposing on a LAN

- **Always set a non-empty `api_key`.** The REST API enforces it, but a network-reachable instance with an obvious or empty key is one `curl` away from full tool execution.
- **Put a firewall in front.** If only one workstation needs access, prefer binding to a single LAN IP (e.g. `"listen": "192.168.1.10:8080"`) or restrict port 8080 in `ufw`/`firewalld` to known source addresses.
- **Consider `require_mcp_auth: true`** if you also want the `/mcp` endpoint to require the API key. It's `false` by default for AI-client compatibility.
- **Don't expose to the public internet without TLS in front.** Run nginx/Caddy/Traefik as a reverse proxy with HTTPS, or tunnel via Tailscale/WireGuard/SSH. The built-in HTTP server is not designed to be a public ingress.

### Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / openSUSE — direct `.rpm` download (fallback)

For air-gapped or offline installs where the dnf repository isn't reachable.

**One-liner (auto-detects latest version):**

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest \
  | grep -oE '"tag_name": *"v[^"]+"' | sed -E 's/.*"v([^"]+)"/\1/')
ARCH=$(uname -m)   # x86_64 or aarch64
curl -fLO "https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest/download/mcpproxy-${VERSION}-1.${ARCH}.rpm"
sudo dnf install "./mcpproxy-${VERSION}-1.${ARCH}.rpm"
```

**Or pin a specific version:**

```bash
# AMD64 (x86_64)
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/download/v0.24.2/mcpproxy-0.24.2-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./mcpproxy-0.24.2-1.x86_64.rpm

# ARM64 (aarch64)
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/download/v0.24.2/mcpproxy-0.24.2-1.aarch64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./mcpproxy-0.24.2-1.aarch64.rpm
```

The same `systemctl` workflow applies. On systems without `dnf`, use `sudo rpm -i ./mcpproxy-*.rpm` or `sudo zypper install ./mcpproxy-*.rpm`.

### Tarball (any distro)

If you don't want a system service or you're on a distro without `.deb`/`.rpm` support, grab the raw binary tarball:

```bash
# AMD64
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest/download/mcpproxy-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf mcpproxy-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo install -m 0755 mcpproxy /usr/local/bin/

# ARM64
curl -LO https://github.com/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go/releases/latest/download/mcpproxy-latest-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf mcpproxy-latest-linux-arm64.tar.gz
sudo install -m 0755 mcpproxy /usr/local/bin/
```

You can then run `mcpproxy serve` directly, or wire up your own systemd unit modelled on the one shipped in the `.deb`/`.rpm`.

### Package layout (.deb / .rpm)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/usr/bin/mcpproxy` | Binary |
| `/lib/systemd/system/mcpproxy.service` | Hardened systemd unit (runs as `mcpproxy` user) |
| `/etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json` | Config (`config|noreplace` — never overwritten on upgrade) |
| `/etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json.example` | Reference example, refreshed on upgrade |
| `/var/lib/mcpproxy/` | Data dir (BBolt DB, search index, per-server logs) |
| `/usr/share/doc/mcpproxy/{LICENSE,README.md}` | Documentation |

The systemd unit launches mcpproxy with `--config=/etc/mcpproxy/mcp_config.json --data-dir=/var/lib/mcpproxy` and uses `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateTmp`, and friends.

## Docker (Server edition)

The Server edition is published as a multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) on
every stable release:

```bash
docker run -d --name mcpproxy \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -e MCPPROXY_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -v mcpproxy-data:/root/.mcpproxy \
  ghcr.io/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-server:latest
```

- **Tags**: `ghcr.io/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-server:<version>` (e.g. `v0.64.0`) and `:latest`,
  which always points at the newest stable release. RC builds publish no image.
- **State survives restarts, not replacement**: `docker restart` keeps everything. Removing and
  re-running the container, upgrading the tag, or rescheduling the pod destroys whatever is not
  on the volume — so mount one before you configure anything.
- **Don't use `MCPPROXY_DATA` or a bare `--data-dir` to relocate state.** The data-dir override is
  applied after the config file is resolved, so the config in that directory is never read and is
  overwritten with a fresh default (rotating the API key) on every boot. Mount the volume at the
  default `/root/.mcpproxy` path instead. (`MCPPROXY_DATA_DIR`, referenced elsewhere in the docs,
  is not implemented at all.)
- **Port**: the entrypoint is `mcpproxy serve --listen 0.0.0.0:8080`, so the container listens on
  `8080` inside the network namespace. The `-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080` above keeps it reachable only
  from the host; drop the `127.0.0.1:` prefix only if you deliberately want it on the network, and
  read [Network exposure: localhost by default](#network-exposure-localhost-by-default) first.
- **State**: config, the BBolt DB, and the search index live in `/root/.mcpproxy`. Mount a volume
  there or every restart starts from an empty config.
- **API key**: the REST API and Web UI require one. Set `MCPPROXY_API_KEY` explicitly and keep a
  copy — the image is distroless (no shell), so reading an auto-generated key back out of the
  container is awkward.
- **Web UI**: `http://localhost:8080/ui/`.

### Behind an ingress with SSO

To put the container behind a TLS-terminating ingress and sign users in through your
IdP, add the `server_edition` block to the config on the volume and pass the secrets as
environment variables that the file references with `${env:...}` — nothing secret is
written into `mcp_config.json`:

```bash
docker run -d --name mcpproxy \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e MCPPROXY_API_KEY \
  -e OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -e MCPPROXY_CRED_KEY \
  -e MCPPROXY_PUBLIC_URL="https://mcp.example.com" \
  -e MCPPROXY_TRUSTED_PROXIES="10.42.0.0/16" \
  -v mcpproxy-data:/root/.mcpproxy \
  ghcr.io/smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-server:latest
```

```json
{
  "listen": "0.0.0.0:8080",
  "trusted_proxies": ["10.42.0.0/16"],
  "server_edition": {
    "enabled": true,
    "admin_emails": ["admin@example.com"],
    "public_url": "https://mcp.example.com",
    "credential_encryption_key": "${env:MCPPROXY_CRED_KEY}",
    "oauth": {
      "provider": "oidc",
      "issuer_url": "https://login.example.com/realms/team",
      "client_id": "mcpproxy",
      "client_secret": "${env:OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`public_url`** is the origin users reach — the IdP `redirect_uri` becomes
  `https://mcp.example.com/api/v1/auth/callback` and the session cookie is `Secure`,
  independent of what the ingress puts in `Host` or `X-Forwarded-*`. The image listens on
  `0.0.0.0:8080`, so leaving it unset is a boot warning and a `mcpproxy doctor` finding.
  `MCPPROXY_PUBLIC_URL` overrides the file value; it is the only nested `server_edition`
  key with an environment alias.
- **`trusted_proxies`** is the ingress's source range as the container sees it. Forwarded
  headers from anywhere else are ignored, so a direct client cannot spoof its address or
  scheme. `MCPPROXY_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (comma list) overrides the file value. `trusted_hosts`
  is unrelated here — it never runs on a non-loopback listener.
- **Secrets** stay in the environment: `client_secret`, `credential_encryption_key` (or
  just `MCPPROXY_CRED_KEY`, its fallback) and the API key. `${env:NAME}` is expanded when
  the file is loaded and the secret is masked in every API response.
- **`/mcp` requires a credential** as soon as `server_edition.enabled` is `true`, whatever
  `require_mcp_auth` says — agent tokens, the API key or the socket; a browser session is
  never an MCP credential.

The full key table — `session_cookie_secure`, `scopes`, `groups_claim`,
`email_verified_policy`, `display_name`, the per-IdP groups-claim notes — is in
[Server Edition](/configuration/config-file#server-edition).

Note that this image ships the Server edition binary (`mcpproxy version` reports `(server)`); it is
the headless core only, with no system tray.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify MCPProxy is working:

```bash
mcpproxy --version
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) guide to configure and run MCPProxy.
