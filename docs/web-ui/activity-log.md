# Activity Log Web UI

The Activity Log page provides real-time monitoring and analysis of all activity across your MCP servers through a web-based interface.

## Overview

Access the Activity Log by navigating to `/ui/activity` in the MCPProxy web interface or by clicking "Activity Log" in the sidebar navigation.

## Features

### Activity Table

The main view displays activities in a sortable table with the following columns:

| Column | Sortable | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Time | Yes | Timestamp with relative time display (e.g., "5m ago"). Default sort: newest first |
| Type | Yes | Activity type with icon indicator |
| Server | Yes | Link to the server that generated the activity |
| Details | No | Tool name or action description |
| Intent | No | Operation type badge (read/write/destructive) with tooltip showing full intent details |
| Status | Yes | Color-coded badge (green=success, red=error, orange=blocked) |
| Duration | Yes | Execution time in ms or seconds |

**Sorting**: Click any sortable column header to sort. Click again to toggle between ascending/descending. The current sort column and direction are indicated with an arrow.

### Activity Types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Tool Call | 🔧 | MCP tool invocations to upstream servers |
| System Start | 🚀 | MCPProxy server startup events |
| System Stop | 🛑 | MCPProxy server shutdown events |
| Internal Tool Call | ⚙️ | Internal proxy tool calls (`retrieve_tools`, `call_tool_*`, `code_execution`, `upstream_servers`, etc.) |
| Config Change | ⚡ | Configuration changes (server added/removed/updated) |
| Policy Decision | 🛡️ | Security policy evaluations |
| Quarantine Change | ⚠️ | Server quarantine status changes |
| Server Change | 🔄 | Server enable/disable/restart events |

### Real-time Updates

Activities appear automatically via Server-Sent Events (SSE):
- New activities are prepended to the list
- Completed activities update their status and duration
- The connection status indicator shows live/disconnected state

### Filtering

Filter activities by:
- **Type**: Multi-select dropdown with checkboxes. Select one or more types to filter (uses OR logic between selected types):
  - Tool Call, System Start, System Stop, Internal Tool Call, Config Change, Policy Decision, Quarantine Change, Server Change
- **Server**: Dynamically populated from activity data
- **Status**: Success, Error, Blocked
- **Date Range**: From/To datetime pickers to filter by time period

Type filters combine with OR logic (show any selected type). Other filters combine with AND logic. Active filters are displayed as badges below the filter controls.

### Activity Details

Click any row to open the detail drawer showing:
- Full metadata (ID, type, timestamp, server, tool, duration, session, source)
- Request arguments displayed in a syntax-highlighted JSON viewer with:
  - Color-coded keys (primary color)
  - Green strings
  - Orange numbers
  - Purple booleans
  - Red null values
  - Copy-to-clipboard button with byte size indicator
- Response data in the same syntax-highlighted JSON viewer with truncation indicator
- Error message (for failed activities)
- Intent declaration (if present)

### Pagination

Navigate through large datasets with:
- First/Previous/Next/Last page buttons
- Page size selector (10, 25, 50, 100 per page)
- "Showing X-Y of Z" count display

### Export

Export filtered activities to JSON or CSV format:
1. Apply desired filters
2. Click the Export dropdown
3. Select format (JSON or CSV)
4. File downloads via browser

### Dashboard Widget

The Dashboard includes an Activity Summary widget showing:
- 24-hour totals (total, success, errors)
- 5 most recent activities
- "View All" link to the Activity Log page

### Auto-refresh Toggle

Control real-time updates:
- Toggle on (default): Activities update automatically via SSE
- Toggle off: Manual refresh required, use the refresh button

## API Endpoints

The Activity Log uses these REST API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/activity` | List activities with filtering |
| `GET /api/v1/activity/{id}` | Get activity details |
| `GET /api/v1/activity/summary` | Get 24h statistics |
| `GET /api/v1/activity/export` | Export activities (JSON/CSV) |

Query parameters for filtering:
- `type`: Filter by activity type (comma-separated for multiple, e.g., `?type=tool_call,config_change`)
- `server`: Filter by server name
- `status`: Filter by status
- `intent_type`: Filter by intent operation type (`read`, `write`, `destructive`)
- `limit`: Maximum records to return
- `offset`: Pagination offset

## SSE Events

Real-time updates are received via these SSE event types:
- `activity.tool_call.started`: Tool call initiated
- `activity.tool_call.completed`: Tool call finished
- `activity.policy_decision`: Policy evaluation result
- `activity`: Generic activity event

## Intent Declaration

For activities with intent declarations (Spec 018), the detail panel displays:
- Operation type with icon (📖 read, ✏️ write, ⚠️ destructive)
- Data sensitivity level
- Reason for the operation

See [CLI Activity Commands](../cli/activity-commands.md) for command-line access to activity data.
