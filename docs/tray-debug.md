# Tray Debugging Guide

This guide explains how to control the mcpproxy tray during development and automated testing using environment variables. The variables below let you attach the tray to a pre-launched core, skip automatic OAuth helpers, and keep instrumentation deterministic.

## Quick Reference

| Variable | Scope | Default | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| `MCPPROXY_HOME` | macOS tray | `~/.mcpproxy` | Relocates the whole instance root: socket, config, database, autostart sidecar, lifecycle journal. |
| `MCPPROXY_SOCKET_PATH` | macOS tray | `<root>/mcpproxy.sock` | Points the tray at one specific core's socket, wherever the root is. |
| `MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE` | Tray | unset | Prevents the tray from launching the core binary. |
| `MCPPROXY_CORE_URL` | Tray | `http://localhost:8080` | Overrides the core API endpoint the tray connects to. |
| `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH` | Core | unset | Disables OAuth popups and tray-driven login prompts. |

## Running a Second (Dev/QA) macOS Tray Instance

The native macOS tray resolves its paths through `homeDirectoryForCurrentUser`, which **ignores `$HOME`**. Without an override, a tray built from a branch and run out of a scratch bundle still reads and writes the real `~/.mcpproxy` — which means QA runs cannot go in parallel (they contend for one socket) and the autostart sidecar overwrites the user's real login-item state on every launch.

`MCPPROXY_HOME` moves the whole instance in one step. It is unset in normal use, and with it unset every path resolves exactly where it always did.

```bash
# Keep the root SHORT: sockaddr_un caps the socket path at 103 bytes, and a
# deep scratch directory silently fails to bind. The tray logs a warning if
# the resolved path is over the limit.
export MCPPROXY_HOME=/tmp/mcpproxy-qa
/path/to/dev/mcpproxy.app/Contents/MacOS/MCPProxy
```

With it set:

| File | Default | With `MCPPROXY_HOME=/tmp/mcpproxy-qa` |
|------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Core socket | `~/.mcpproxy/mcpproxy.sock` | `/tmp/mcpproxy-qa/mcpproxy.sock` |
| Config opened by **Open Config File** | `~/.mcpproxy/mcp_config.json` | `/tmp/mcpproxy-qa/mcp_config.json` |
| Autostart sidecar | `~/.mcpproxy/tray-autostart.json` | `/tmp/mcpproxy-qa/tray-autostart.json` |
| Lifecycle journal | `~/.mcpproxy/tray-lifecycle.jsonl` | `/tmp/mcpproxy-qa/tray-lifecycle.jsonl` |
| Spawned core | `mcpproxy serve` | `mcpproxy serve --data-dir /tmp/mcpproxy-qa --config /tmp/mcpproxy-qa/mcp_config.json` |

Notes and limits:

- A brand-new root needs nothing prepared. The core creates the config file named by `--config` when it does not exist yet (printing `INFO: Created default configuration file at …`), so `export MCPPROXY_HOME=/tmp/mcpproxy-qa` and launching the tray is the whole setup. An existing file is never touched.
- The core also reads its autostart sidecar out of the data directory it was given, so a QA instance reports its own login-item state rather than the real install's.
- `MCPPROXY_SOCKET_PATH` still wins over the root. Use it to attach to a core somebody else started; use `MCPPROXY_HOME` to own a whole instance.
- **Not** relocated: `~/Library/Logs/mcpproxy` (the core's log directory, which follows the core's own rules) and the app's preferences domain — `cfprefsd` honours neither `$HOME` nor this variable, so give a dev bundle a distinct bundle id if you need separate defaults.
- The first-run dialog is a `UserDefaults` flag, so it lives in the preferences domain rather than the instance root; a fresh bundle id will show it again. Its "Launch at login" checkbox is pre-checked, so clicking through it in a dev instance registers a real login item.

## Attributing a Tray or Core Exit

Every start and stop is recorded in `<instance root>/tray-lifecycle.jsonl`, one JSON object per line, and mirrored to the macOS unified log at Notice level (`log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.smartmcpproxy.mcpproxy"'`) — Notice because the Info and Debug tiers are purged within hours, which is precisely why an earlier silent exit could not be attributed.

```bash
tail -5 ~/.mcpproxy/tray-lifecycle.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool --json-lines
```

Recorded events: `appLaunched`, `appTerminating`, `signalReceived`, `coreLaunched`, `coreTerminated`, `coreExited`, `updateCheck`. Each carries a free-text reason, the uptime of the tray process, and a pid.

The rules worth knowing when reading one:

- Every shutdown records **who asked**. A shutdown nobody claimed is written as `unattributed (no initiator claimed this shutdown)` rather than as something plausible.
- `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and `SIGHUP` are caught, recorded, and then routed through the normal quit path — handled off the main thread, so a wedged main thread cannot swallow them. If the app has not gone five seconds later, the signal's default action is restored and re-raised: catching a termination signal delays the exit, it never prevents it. `SIGKILL` and a jetsam kill cannot be caught by anyone.
- Which is why the **next** launch reports an unaccounted-for previous run: if the previous run recorded no `appTerminating` at all, the new `appLaunched` record says so and names the last thing the dead run did. That marker is the signature of a SIGKILL-class death (jetsam, `pkill`, power loss) or a crash outside the app's handlers. It is not the *last* record that decides this — an ordinary clean exit writes `appTerminating` first and then `coreTerminated` for the core it tears down.
- The journal is trimmed to its newest 500 records at launch.

## Use Cases

### Debugging the Core and Tray Separately

When you want to attach two debuggers (one for the core binary, another for the tray) or restart the core without bouncing the tray:

```bash
# terminal 1: start the core with verbose logging
MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH=true \
go run ./cmd/mcpproxy serve --listen :8085 --tray=false --log-level=debug

# terminal 2: build + run the tray without auto-spawning the core
MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE=1 \
MCPPROXY_CORE_URL=http://localhost:8085 \
go run ./cmd/mcpproxy-tray
```

**What happens**
- The tray icon appears immediately and connects to `:8085` once the core is ready.
- Because `MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE` is set, the tray never forks a new `mcpproxy` process. This lets you rebuild or restart the core freely.
- `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH=true` ensures no OAuth browser windows are spawned during debugging.

### VS Code Compound Debugging

Add the following launch configurations to `.vscode/launch.json` (already included in the repo’s example setup):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Debug mcpproxy (.tree/next)",
  "type": "go",
  "request": "launch",
  "mode": "exec",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/.tree/next/mcpproxy",
  "args": ["serve", "--listen", ":8085", "--tray", "false"],
  "env": {
    "CGO_ENABLED": "1",
    "MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH": "true"
  }
},
{
  "name": "Debug mcpproxy-tray (.tree/next)",
  "type": "go",
  "request": "launch",
  "mode": "exec",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/.tree/next/mcpproxy-tray",
  "env": {
    "CGO_ENABLED": "1",
    "MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE": "1",
    "MCPPROXY_CORE_URL": "http://localhost:8085"
  }
}
```

With a compound configuration that launches both entries, pressing F5 will:
1. Start the core under the debugger without tray UI.
2. Attach the tray to the already debugging core.

### Automated UI Testing

For Playwright, scripted tray checks, or MCP automation harnesses:

```bash
# Start the core in headless mode
MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH=true \
MCPPROXY_CORE_URL=http://localhost:18080 \
mcpproxy serve --listen :18080 --tray=false &

# Launch the tray with instrumentation enabled
MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE=true \
MCPPROXY_CORE_URL=http://localhost:18080 \
MCPPROXY_TRAY_INSPECT_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8765 \
go run -tags traydebug ./cmd/mcpproxy-tray
```

The `traydebug` build tag exposes an HTTP inspector (see `/state`, `/action`) so automated tests can query the tray menu without needing Accessibility permissions.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If the tray still spawns a core instance, confirm `MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE` is set to `1` or `true` in the tray process environment.
- The core URL must include the protocol (e.g. `http://`); otherwise the Go HTTP client rejects it.
- Combine `MCPPROXY_DISABLE_OAUTH` with test configs to avoid OAuth popups in CI or when running unit tests.
- When running against non-default ports, update your MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) to use the same port.

### Resolving Port Conflicts

If another process already uses the configured listen port, the tray now surfaces a **Resolve port conflict** sub-menu directly beneath the status indicator. From there you can:

- Retry the existing port once you have freed it.
- Automatically switch to the next available port (the tray persists the new value and restarts the core for you).
- Copy the MCP connection URL to the clipboard for quick use in clients.
- Jump straight to the configuration directory if you prefer manual edits.

For scripted verification on macOS you can drive the new menu via `osascript`:

```applescript
osascript <<'EOF'
tell application "System Events"
  tell process "mcpproxy-tray"
    click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1
    click menu item "Resolve port conflict" of menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1
    delay 0.2
    click menu item "Use available port" of menu 1 of menu item "Resolve port conflict" of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1
  end tell
end tell
EOF
```

Adjust the inner menu titles if you localise the app; the defaults above match the English build.

### Launcher Configuration

The tray launches `mcpproxy serve` when it detects that no core is running. You can steer that subprocess with the following environment variables before starting the tray:

- `MCPPROXY_CORE_URL` – full base URL the tray should connect to (e.g. `http://localhost:8085`). This also controls the health checks.
- `MCPPROXY_CORE_PATH` – custom path to the mcpproxy core binary (defaults to bundled binary or PATH lookup).
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_LISTEN` / `MCPPROXY_TRAY_PORT` – override the address passed to `--listen` when the tray launches the core (formats accepted: `127.0.0.1:8085`, `:8085` or `8085`). The host is never widened: a pinned host is forwarded as written, and a bare port (`8085`) binds loopback. Note that an all-interfaces value set *through these variables* (`:8085`, `0.0.0.0:8085`) is narrowed to loopback, because the tray derives the core's `--listen` from the URL it dials; use the tray's own `--listen` flag when you actually want a LAN-exposed bind. That flag takes precedence over both variables, and when it is set and the port is busy the tray reports the conflict instead of moving the core to another port.
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_CONFIG_PATH` – absolute path to the `mcp_config.json` the tray should hand to the core via `--config`.
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_EXTRA_ARGS` – optional additional CLI arguments (whitespace separated) appended after `serve`.
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_SKIP_CORE` – set to `1` to prevent the tray from launching the core automatically (useful when attaching to an external instance).
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_CORE_TIMEOUT` – timeout in seconds for core server startup (default: 30).
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_RETRY_DELAY` – retry delay in milliseconds for core server connection (default: 1000).
- `MCPPROXY_TRAY_STATE_DEBUG` – set to `1` to enable state machine debug logging.

The tray’s status tooltip reflects the active listen address; when you change any of the variables above, restart the tray so it relaunches the core with the new settings.

### Building a DMG with Both Binaries

Use the updated packaging script to bundle the tray and core into a single notarizable DMG:

```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/mcpproxy-tray ./cmd/mcpproxy-tray
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/mcpproxy ./cmd/mcpproxy
./scripts/create-dmg.sh dist/mcpproxy-tray dist/mcpproxy v1.0.0 arm64
```

The resulting `mcpproxy.app` contains:

- `Contents/MacOS/mcpproxy` – the tray executable.
- `Contents/Resources/bin/mcpproxy` – the CLI core binary that the tray stages at runtime.

When the DMG is mounted the user only needs to drag the app bundle to `/Applications`; the tray will manage the core automatically from that embedded location.
