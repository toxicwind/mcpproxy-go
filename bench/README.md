# mcpproxy benchmark harness

The reproducible numbers behind mcpproxy's marketing claims — **token reduction**,
**discovery accuracy**, and **latency** — comparing three ways an agent can be
wired to upstream MCP tools, plus the **discovery-effectiveness profiler**
(Spec 083): encoding-arm comparisons, real-MCP response cost, break-even
analysis, session-cost estimates, public-corpus validation, and an independent
LAP verdict.

> Roadmap item #19 (MCP-42) + Spec 083. In-repo (`bench/`), reproducible,
> intended to be refreshed on release. Reports are **never committed** (Spec 065
> CN-003); only code, fixtures, and this methodology are versioned.

## The three modes

| Mode | What the agent sees in context | mcpproxy server |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| `baseline` | Every upstream tool definition, loaded directly | (no proxy discovery) |
| `retrieve_tools` | `retrieve_tools` + `call_tool_read/write/destructive` + `read_cache` + `code_execution` + management tools; tools found on demand via BM25 | `callToolServer` |
| `code_execution` | `code_execution` + `retrieve_tools` + management tools; many tools orchestrated from sandboxed JS in one round-trip | `codeExecServer` |

Both proxy modes also append the shared **management tool set** —
`upstream_servers`, `quarantine_security`, `search_servers`, `list_registries`
— that the live routing-mode servers expose. These count against the proxy
context cost: omitting them undercounts that cost and inflates the savings.

The per-mode catalog is **derived directly from the live tool builders**
(`buildCallToolModeTools` / `buildCodeExecModeTools` in
`internal/server/mcp_routing.go`, via `server.ProxyModeToolDefs`), so it can
never drift from production.

## What ships today (deterministic, offline)

The **token-reduction** measurement is fully deterministic and runs with no
network or LLM:

```bash
go run ./bench/cmd/bench            # scores the committed Spec 065 corpus (v1 report)
make bench-discovery                # Spec 083 profiler: all encoding arms on corpus_v2 (v2 report)
go test ./bench/...                 # unit + invariant tests
```

It counts the context-token cost of each mode over a **frozen tool corpus** and
reports the savings of each proxy mode versus the baseline. Output: a
`report.json` and a self-contained `dashboard.html` in `bench/results/`
(gitignored).

#### Current deterministic result

Over the 45-tool Spec 065 reference corpus, counting **tool name + description
only** (schemas excluded uniformly — see limitations), `cl100k_base`:

| Mode | Context tools | Tokens | Savings vs. baseline |
|------|---------------|--------|----------------------|
| `baseline` | 45 | 1730 | — |
| `retrieve_tools` | 10 | 1431 | **~17%** |
| `code_execution` | 6 | 986 | **~43%** |

These are deliberately modest: the proxy context here is the *full* per-mode
tool set (discovery + call-tool variants + management tools), and the corpus is
small. Savings grow toward the asymptote as the upstream tool count rises (the
baseline grows linearly while the proxy context stays fixed) — always quote the
corpus size alongside a percentage. Reproduce with `go run ./bench/cmd/bench`.

### Scoring rubric — token reduction

- **Tool universe**: the frozen Spec 065 snapshot
  `specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/corpus_v1.tools.json` — 45 tools
  across 7 no-auth reference servers. Frozen + versioned so scoring never runs
  against a drifting corpus (CN-002).
- **Tokenizer**: `tiktoken cl100k_base`, a widely-used reproducible BPE
  (already a repo dependency). It is a **model-agnostic estimator** — see the
  tokenizer caveat under "Known limitations" before quoting an absolute number.
- **Proxy-mode tools**: the *complete* per-mode catalog, derived from the live
  server builders — discovery, the call-tool variants, `code_execution`, **and
  the shared management tool set** (`upstream_servers`, `quarantine_security`,
  `search_servers`, `list_registries`). Nothing the agent actually sees is
  dropped from the proxy cost.
- **Cost of a tool**: `name + "\n" + description`. JSON input schemas are
  excluded **uniformly** across all modes (the committed corpus snapshot does
  not carry schemas). The Spec 083 profiler measures schema-bearing renderings
  on `corpus_v2` instead.
- **Savings** for a mode `m`: `1 - tokens(m) / tokens(baseline)`.

## Discovery-effectiveness profiler (Spec 083)

The profiler answers three questions the v1 harness could not: **what does a
`retrieve_tools` response actually cost** over the real MCP protocol, **which
tool-definition encoding is cheapest** without wrecking retrieval quality, and
**do the in-house numbers survive external corpora and an independent linter**.
Output is a versioned **v2 report** (`report.json` conforming to
`specs/083-discovery-profiler/contracts/report-v2.schema.json`) plus a
self-contained `dashboard.html`, where every headline number carries a
**provenance badge**: `measured` (observed on the wire), `computed`
(deterministic arithmetic over measurements), or `estimated` (a model with
documented assumptions).

### Quickstart

One command (SC-008):

```bash
make bench-discovery
# = npm ci --prefix bench/tscg  (pinned @tscg/core, one-time)
#   + go run ./bench/cmd/bench -corpus-v2 ... -arms all -out bench/results
# → bench/results/report.json (v2) + bench/results/dashboard.html
# CI runs this same target.
```

Offline (deterministic, no network):

```bash
# All mandatory arms on the schema-bearing frozen corpus
go run ./bench/cmd/bench \
  -corpus-v2 specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/corpus_v2.tools.json \
  -arms baseline_json,compact_sig,tscg,toon_listing \
  -out bench/results
```

TSCG arm prerequisite (covered by `make bench-discovery`): `npm ci --prefix
bench/tscg` (Node ≥20). Without it the arm reports `skipped: node runtime
unavailable` (allowed locally, fails SC-002 in CI).

Live (response cost + break-even + latency):

```bash
# 1. Boot the snapshot proxy (same as existing bench live mode)
go build -o mcpproxy ./cmd/mcpproxy
./mcpproxy serve --config specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/snapshot-servers.config.json \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8092 &   # MCPPROXY_API_KEY=eval-corpus-snapshot

# 2. Run live measurement (real MCP retrieve_tools calls per golden query)
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -live \
  -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8092 -api-key eval-corpus-snapshot \
  -golden specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/retrieval_golden_v1.json \
  -out bench/results
```

Public corpora:

```bash
# ToolRet (runtime fetch — never committed; license unstated upstream)
./scripts/fetch-toolret.sh                # uv-run parquet→JSON into bench/results/cache/toolret/
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -toolret bench/results/cache/toolret \
  -subset 250 -seed 42 -arms baseline_json,compact_sig -out bench/results

# LiveMCPTool (committed Apache-2.0 snapshot) — token/scale measurement
go run ./bench/cmd/bench \
  -livemcptool specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/livemcptool_snapshot \
  -arms baseline_json,compact_sig,tscg,toon_listing -out bench/results
```

Independent LAP verdict (what CI runs):

```bash
uvx --from lap-score==0.8.0 lap lint \
  --mcp-url "http://127.0.0.1:8092/mcp?apikey=eval-corpus-snapshot" --json > bench/results/lap.json
```

Regenerating fixtures (maintainers only):

```bash
./scripts/gen-corpus-v2.sh     # schema-bearing frozen corpus from booted snapshot proxy
# result_fixtures_v1.json: captured once from reference servers; see datasets/README
```

Verifying success criteria:

- SC-003 gate: baseline arm on in-house golden set must report recall@5 = 0.68 ± 0.05.
- SC-001: report.json `.response_cost.p50/.p95`, `.break_even.break_even_calls` populated after a live run.
- SC-005: dashboard shows provenance badge + tokenizer caveat on every headline number.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-corpus` | `specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/corpus_v1.tools.json` | Legacy v1 corpus (name+description only); used when no profiler flag is set |
| `-out` | `bench/results` | Output directory for `report.json` + `dashboard.html` |
| `-encoding` | `cl100k_base` | tiktoken encoding name |
| `-live` | off | Live benchmark against a running proxy: full-schema tokens, accuracy, latency, **and** real-MCP response cost + break-even |
| `-proxy` | `http://127.0.0.1:8092` | Live proxy base URL |
| `-api-key` | `eval-corpus-snapshot` | Live proxy API key (`X-API-Key`; the MCP session uses `?apikey=`) |
| `-golden` | `specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/retrieval_golden_v1.json` | Retrieval golden set (the SC-003 gate corpus) |
| `-arms` | (empty) | Comma-separated encoding arms, or `all` — enables profiler mode. `toon_results` is selectable here as a fixture-driven pseudo-arm |
| `-corpus-v2` | (empty) | Spec 083 schema-bearing frozen corpus (`corpus_v2.tools.json`) |
| `-toolret` | (empty) | ToolRet cache dir from `scripts/fetch-toolret.sh` (revision dir, or its parent with exactly one revision) — runtime fetch, never committed |
| `-livemcptool` | (empty) | LiveMCPTool committed snapshot directory (or its `tools.json`) |
| `-subset` | `250` | Seeded ToolRet query-subset size (FR-014) |
| `-seed` | `42` | Seed for the deterministic query subset — same revision+seed+size ⇒ same subset |
| `-lap-json` | (empty) | Path to a LAP lint artifact to merge as the independent verdict |
| `-result-fixtures` | `specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/result_fixtures_v1.json` | Tool-result fixture set for the `toon_results` arm |

Any of `-arms` / `-corpus-v2` / `-toolret` / `-livemcptool` switches the CLI
into profiler mode (v2 report); `-live` runs the live benchmark and *also*
emits a v2 report; with none of them the legacy v1 offline run executes.

### Encoding arms

An **arm** is one deterministic way of rendering tool definitions into
agent-context text (`bench/arms/`; behavioral contract in
`specs/083-discovery-profiler/contracts/arm-interface.md`). Arms are
byte-deterministic (FR-010), fail explicitly instead of truncating silently
(an unencodable tool is a counted *skip*, with examples in the report), and
declare whether they alter what the retrieval index ingests — index-altering
arms are scored for retrieval quality through the production Bleve index
(`bench/armindex.go`), where the baseline arm must reproduce the golden-set
recall@5 = 0.68 ± 0.05 (SC-003 gate).

| Arm | What it renders (one-line example) | Index-altering | Lower-bound |
|-----|-------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| `baseline_json` | Full definition, canonical JSON schema — `fetch` ⏎ `Fetches a URL from the internet…` ⏎ `{"properties":{"url":{…}},"required":["url"],…}`. THE canonical renderer: it is also the naive-menu count, every savings denominator, and the break-even input | no | no |
| `compact_sig` | Flat signature `fetch(url:string, max_length?:int, raw?:bool, start_index?:int)\|Fetches a URL from the internet…` — required vs `opt?` params, nested objects collapse to `obj`, descriptions preserved verbatim | yes | no |
| `tscg` | Reference TSCG compiler (pinned `@tscg/core@1.4.3` via the committed Node shim `bench/tscg/shim.mjs`, JSONL protocol) — `fetch: Fetches a URL…` ⏎ `  max_length (integer): Maximum number of characters… \| raw (bool): …`. Rewrites/elides description filler, so savings are a **lower bound**. Without node/`node_modules` the whole arm is a skip-with-reason row (never per-tool failures) | yes | yes |
| `toon_listing` | Official [TOON](https://github.com/toon-format) encoding (toon-go) of `{name, description, inputSchema}` per tool — `- name: fetch` ⏎ `  description: "Fetches a URL…"` ⏎ `  inputSchema:` ⏎ `    properties: …` | yes | no |
| `tron_dedup` | In-tree TRON-style named-class schema dedup (no upstream Go impl): byte-identical canonical schemas declared once in the listing preamble — `class Cbae0cfe3 = {…canonical schema…}` — and referenced per tool as `fetch\|Fetches a URL…\|Cbae0cfe3`. Content-addressed class names, exact-bytes dedup key: deliberately conservative vs. the paper (deviations documented in `bench/arms/tron.go`) | yes | no |
| `toon_results` | Pseudo-arm over **tool-call outputs**, not definitions: the committed `result_fixtures_v1.json` payloads encoded as TOON vs. a compact-JSON baseline of the same payloads, split tabular vs. non-tabular. Selectable via `-arms`; included automatically by `-arms all` when the fixture file exists | n/a | no |

Listing-level amortization (TOON header, TRON class preamble) lives only in
`EncodeListing`; per-tool means stay comparable across arms. Each arm row also
reports skip counts with examples, the top-N heaviest tools, and the corpus's
degenerate-description count (FR-020: description missing, shorter than 20
runes, or matching stub patterns) so cheap-but-useless corpora are visible.

### Live response cost, break-even, and session estimates (US1)

The `-live` run now measures what the v1 REST-based run could not — the
**response** an agent pays for on every discovery call:

- **Real MCP protocol.** `bench/mcpcall.go` speaks streamable-HTTP MCP
  (mark3labs/mcp-go) against the proxy's `/mcp` endpoint and calls
  `retrieve_tools` for every golden query — capturing the exact response text
  an agent's context ingests (REST `/api/v1/index/search` misses
  `usage_instructions`, `call_with`, annotations, `session_risk`), plus
  client-measured latency. Provenance: `measured`.
- **Span-based component attribution** (`bench/respcost.go`). Per-query tokens
  split into `input_schemas` / `descriptions` / `usage_instructions` /
  `metadata` / `other`. BPE is not additive across concatenation boundaries, so
  the response is partitioned into labeled byte spans, tokenized **once**, and
  each token attributed to the span owning its starting byte — components sum
  *exactly* to the total (FR-002), by construction. Percentiles: p50/p95/max +
  mean.
- **Break-even** (`bench/breakeven.go`): `break_even_calls =
  (naive_full_menu_tokens − proxy_menu_tokens) / mean_response_tokens`, all
  three inputs echoed in the row so the number is recomputable. Both menus come
  from the same canonical renderer. Numerator ≤ 0 ⇒ explicit `no_break_even`
  row; break-even is withheld when menu token counts are non-authoritative
  (see the MCP-3161 safety valve below). Provenance: `computed`.
- **Session-cost estimator** (`bench/session.go`) — an ESTIMATE, not a
  measurement: `session_cost(arm, calls) = proxy_menu + calls ×
  mean_response(arm) × (1 + retry_rate(arm))` for `calls ∈ {1,3,5,10}`.
  `retry_rate` defaults are literature-derived (0.0 for format-native
  JSON/compact/TSCG/TRON; 0.05 for `toon_listing`, per the parsing-cascade
  evidence in arXiv:2605.29676 §5) and echoed in every row. Provenance:
  `estimated`, always.

### LAP independent verdict (US4)

CI runs the version-pinned external linter `lap-score==0.8.0` against the
booted proxy (command in the quickstart) and merges its artifact via
`-lap-json`: the report's `lap` block carries LAP's letter grade and
menu-token count, compared against the in-house count of the same surface.
Both use `cl100k_base` but frame the menu differently, so divergence within
**±15%** is expected; beyond it the report shows a **non-blocking** warning
(FR-016). LAP being absent or broken never fails the benchmark (FR-015): every
failure path yields `executed: false` with an explicit skip reason.

## Live run — full schemas + accuracy + latency

The live run boots mcpproxy over the Spec 065 reference-server config and
measures the headline claims against a *running* proxy. Everything here is
still deterministic and LLM-free.

```bash
# 1. Boot the reproducible substrate (proxy + 7 no-auth reference servers)
docker compose -f bench/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# 2. Score against the running proxy (writes bench/results/live_report.json + v2 report)
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -live -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8092 -api-key eval-corpus-snapshot
```

What it adds over the offline token run:

- **Exact token number (full schemas).** Pulls `GET /api/v1/tools` for the
  upstream tools *with their full JSON input schemas* and counts them against
  the proxy modes — whose management-tool schemas come from the same live
  builders as the offline run (`server.ProxyModeToolDefs`). Because schemas are
  counted on **both** sides, the savings is authoritative.
  - **Safety valve (MCP-3161):** if any proxy tool is missing a schema, counting
    the baseline's schemas alone would *overstate* savings, so the run
    **withholds the headline %** and reports raw token totals only
    (`authoritative_headline: false`) — and withholds break-even, which depends
    on the same menus. Never quote a withheld run.
- **Accuracy.** Replays `retrieval_golden_v1.json` through the proxy's BM25
  search (`GET /api/v1/index/search`) and scores **Recall@{1,3,5,10}, MRR,
  nDCG@10, MAP** against the graded labels. Deterministic (BM25), so a single
  run is reported (`runs_averaged: 1`). The emitted `retrieval` block **conforms
  to** the Spec 065 `score-report.schema.json` shape — nested `metrics` + `gate`
  (verified by a schema-validation test). A standalone live run has no stored
  baseline to regress against, so `gate.passed` is `true` by construction;
  CI regression-gating against a committed baseline is the MCP-3133 lane.
- **Latency.** Client-measured per-query search latency (p50/p95/p99/max) vs.
  the one-shot cost of loading all tools. Measured client-side on purpose: the
  server's `SearchToolsResponse.took` field is currently a `"0ms"` stub.
- **Response cost + break-even (Spec 083 US1)** — see the profiler section
  above. The live run emits both the v1 `live_report.json` and the v2
  `report.json`/`dashboard.html`.

### Compact arm / flip gates (Spec 085, `-flip-gates`)

`-live -flip-gates` additionally replays the golden set through the proxy's
**MCP** `retrieve_tools` tool twice per query — once with `detail=full`, once
with `detail=compact` (same pipeline, FR-017) — and emits the Spec 085
flip-gate metrics under `flip_gates` in `live_report.json` (FR-018):

- per-query **ranked-ID identity** across modes (gate: 100%, SC-002 — any
  mismatch is listed and fails the gate),
- full vs compact **response-token distributions** (p50/p95/max) and the
  median reduction (SC-001 gates on ≥50% on a real corpus),
- the **lossy-signature rate** via the shared `internal/toolsig` grammar
  (gate: <20%, SC-005), with the heaviest signatures for triage,
- `describe_tool` usage per completed task (informational; populated by the
  E2E suite, not a live run).

```bash
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -live -flip-gates -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8092 -api-key eval-corpus-snapshot
```

## Real-workload replay + agent loop (Spec 103)

Everything above scores a **frozen corpus**. Spec 103 adds the two entry points
that score a **real workload**: a deterministic *replay* of recorded activity
(no model spend, US1) and a live *agent loop* under a pinned model (US2). The
replay entry point lands with US1; the agent loop is gated on an operator
decision (pinned model + spend ceiling) and is tracked under "not yet built"
below until that is made.

Both cross the **five-cell mode matrix** — `retrieve_full`, `retrieve_compact`,
`direct_full`, `direct_deferred`, `code_exec`. The three axes (routing mode ×
response mode × schema detail) have twelve combinations, but only five are
distinct behaviours; the other seven are configurable, redundant, and reported
as skip rows naming the cell they collapse onto.

### Replay — recompute a recorded workload (deterministic, no model spend)

**1. Export a real workload**, from a machine that has been using mcpproxy for
real work:

```bash
mcpproxy activity export --format json > ~/replay-corpus.jsonl
```

CSV is not a valid input: it drops `work_session_id`, the byte fields and the
call arguments, so it can neither group units of work nor account tokens.

**2. Recompute across the matrix. A fleet input is MANDATORY** — a menu cost is
a property of the tool definitions the agent was shown, and the activity export
carries no fleet snapshot. The recording contributes the *call shape* (sequence,
tool mix, call counts); it does not contribute fleet size. A recording-only
invocation is a **hard error, not a degraded run**.

```bash
# Frozen fleet (reproducible):
go run ./bench/cmd/bench \
  -replay ~/replay-corpus.jsonl \
  -corpus-v2 specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/corpus_v2.tools.json \
  -out bench/results

# ...or read today's fleet from a live proxy instead:
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -replay ~/replay-corpus.jsonl \
  -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8092 -api-key "$KEY" -out bench/results
```

Either way the workload is scored against the **supplied** fleet, not the fleet
as it stood when the session was recorded. That is internally valid across cells
and is *not* a historical reconstruction — the report says so on every figure.

**3. Bodies-off is the DEFAULT, and it decides which figures exist.** The export
path does not mask (masking is wired into the list and detail handlers only), so
a bodies-on export is raw and unmasked by design. Bodies-on is therefore a
separate, explicit opt-in that prints a warning, and content is tokenized inside
the loader — only counts cross the boundary, never text.

| | bodies-off (default) | bodies-on (opt-in) |
|---|---|---|
| Menu cost, all five cells | **measured** (from the fleet input) | measured |
| Absolute complete-workload cost | **unavailable for every cell** — reported unavailable, never as zero | measurable where bodies survive |
| `direct_full` vs `direct_deferred` delta | **measured** — their call responses are identical and cancel | measured |
| `retrieve_full` / `retrieve_compact` / `code_exec` deltas | unavailable — the mode changes the response body itself | measured |
| Response cost generally | `estimated` at best (`request_bytes`/`response_bytes` are **byte lengths**, not token counts) | measured |

**4. Read the exclusion report before the headline.** Truncated,
bodies-missing, sensitive and unreplayable records are each detected and
**counted**; a truncated record never contributes silently. A corpus that is 80%
truncated yields a real number over a small slice, and the report says so.
Two caveats worth internalizing: `has_sensitive_data` is derived from detection
metadata added *asynchronously* after persistence, so exclude-by-flag is a
best-effort reducer and never a guarantee; and the activity log stores the FULL
pre-truncation `retrieve_tools` response while the agent consumed truncated
text, so a truncated record tokenized as-is **overstates** cost.

**5. Verify determinism** (SC-002) — two runs are byte-identical once the
wall-clock stamp is removed:

```bash
CORPUS=specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/corpus_v2.tools.json
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -replay ~/replay-corpus.jsonl -corpus-v2 $CORPUS -out /tmp/run-a
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -replay ~/replay-corpus.jsonl -corpus-v2 $CORPUS -out /tmp/run-b
diff <(jq 'del(.generated_at)' /tmp/run-a/report.json) \
     <(jq 'del(.generated_at)' /tmp/run-b/report.json) \
  && echo "byte-identical modulo generated_at (SC-002)"
```

**6. Delete the input when you are finished.**

```bash
rm -f ~/replay-corpus.jsonl
```

A replay input is raw user traffic. Keep it **outside the repository**, never
commit it, and delete it when the run is done — it is gitignored nowhere
precisely because it should never be inside the repo in the first place.

### Agent loop — tokens per *completed* task (costs model spend)

The replay half is a **counterfactual** over recorded traffic: what the same
call shape would have cost per cell. It is not observed agent behaviour, and no
replay figure may be published without that label. The agent loop is the half
that observes behaviour, and it is the only part that costs spend.

- **One instance, whole matrix.** All three routing-mode servers are mounted at
  startup, so a cell is selected by **endpoint URL**; only the two serialization
  axes need config, and both hot-reload. Enable code execution if `code_exec` is
  in scope — without it that cell is degenerate and is skipped with a reason.
- **Stand up the full fleet**, even when running one service's tasks. A single
  server's toolset is too small a fleet for proxy modes to differ from baseline,
  and the full fleet is also the honest **baseline arm**: same agent, same
  tasks, all tools loaded directly.
- **k ≥ 4 runs per cell.** A single agentic run is noise; every
  model-dependent figure is an average over at least four runs with its spread,
  or it is not a headline.
- **Four figures per cell**: tokens per completed task, completion rate,
  first-attempt success and retry rate. The retry classification rule
  (corrective vs infrastructure) must be applied **identically to the baseline
  arm and the proxy arms**, or the comparison is biased toward whichever arm
  carries richer error signal.
- **Accounting sources are never summed.** Deterministic figures come from the
  local tiktoken estimator; live figures come from provider-reported usage. A
  cross-source aggregate is withheld with a stated reason instead — and a mode
  that costs less while completing less is marked a **regression**, whatever its
  token figure says.

### Offline prerequisite (both halves)

`tiktoken` downloads its vocabulary on first use unless the cache directory is
both named **and populated**:

```bash
export TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/tiktoken"
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -corpus-v2 specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/corpus_v2.tools.json \
  -out /tmp/warm   # warms the cache; needs network exactly once
```

Setting the variable only *names* a cache; it does not fill one. A genuinely
offline reproduction needs the cache pre-populated — warm it once with network
access, or restore a known-good copy (which is what `.github/workflows/bench.yml`
does via its `actions/cache` step).

### Reproducing a published figure (SC-004)

Someone with no prior context reproduces the deterministic figures **exactly**,
and the model-dependent ones within the stated numeric tolerance (FR-022 — see
the tokenizer caveat under "Known limitations"), by following these steps and
nothing else.

**1. Populate the tokenizer cache. Naming it is not filling it.**

```bash
export TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/tiktoken"
go run ./bench/cmd/bench \
  -corpus-v2 specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/corpus_v2.tools.json \
  -out /tmp/warm             # downloads the vocabulary once — needs network
ls "$TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR"     # non-empty ⇒ every later run is genuinely offline
```

`TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR` only *names* a directory. A first run with the variable set
and the directory empty still reaches the network, so a machine "configured for
offline" but never warmed fails at the first token count rather than at
configuration time — and it fails the same way on an air-gapped reviewer's
laptop as it does in a network-restricted CI job. Warm it once with network
access, or restore a known-good copy (which is what `.github/workflows/bench.yml`
does via its `actions/cache` step).

**2. Supply a fleet input. There is no default, and there is no fallback.**

A menu cost is a property of the tool definitions the agent was shown. A
recording carries the *call shape* — sequence, tool mix, call counts — and no
fleet snapshot whatsoever, so a recording-only invocation has nothing to price:

```bash
go run ./bench/cmd/bench -replay ~/replay-corpus.jsonl -out bench/results
# bench: replay requires a fleet input as well as a recording: a menu is a
# property of the tool definitions and the activity export carries no fleet
# snapshot, so a recording on its own computes nothing — pass a frozen corpus
# or a live-proxy catalog (this is an error, not a degraded run)
# exit status 1
```

That is a **hard error, not a degraded run**. The alternative — quietly scoring
against an empty or assumed fleet — would produce a plausible-looking number
with no fleet shape behind it, which is exactly the failure every percentage in
this report carries a `fleet_shape` to prevent. Pass the frozen corpus for a
reproducible figure, or a live `-proxy` for today's fleet.

**3. Run the pinned command, twice.** The deterministic half is byte-identical
across runs once the wall-clock stamp is removed — the `diff` recipe under
"Verify determinism" above is the check, and it is what SC-002 means. If two
runs on the same machine differ by anything other than `generated_at`, stop:
nothing downstream is worth comparing yet.

**4. Read the three honesty marks before quoting anything.** They are fields in
`report.json`, not prose in this file, because a report travels without its
README:

| Field | Says | If it is missing |
|-------|------|------------------|
| `run_status.completeness` | `complete`, or `partial` with a reason and the unmeasured cells named | Undeclared completeness — the run is **not publishable** as a complete comparison (FR-032) |
| `<block>.inputs.independently_reproducible` | whether an outsider can obtain the inputs at all | Undeclared availability — treated as **not** reproducible, and blocks publication (FR-030) |
| `<block>.records` | where this block's raw per-run records sit, as a path relative to the run directory | No `records` key at all blocks publication; `retention: not_retained` does not — the figure is real, just no longer traceable to its inputs (FR-029) |

`bench.ReportV2.PublicationCheck()` applies all three and returns blockers plus
caveats. A partial run blocks. An undeclared input blocks. A report in which
*every* block rests on a private recording blocks — see step 5.

**5. Know what you cannot reproduce.** A replay run over someone's own exported
activity is scored from **private recorded sessions**: the recording is raw user
traffic, it is never published (FR-006), and no procedure exists that would hand
it to you. Such a block is marked `independently_reproducible: false` with the
limitation stated in the document, and it may **never be the sole support for a
published claim** — a report whose only figures come from one operator's
recording is a claim nobody outside can check, however honestly each row is
labelled. Publish it beside a block an outsider *can* reproduce (the committed
corpora, or a pinned public task suite), and keep the caveat attached.

**6. Raw records are run-local and not durable.** They are written under the
gitignored `bench/results/` tree — the same tree SC-011 forbids committing and
the same tree a cleanup empties. The report references them by a path relative
to its own directory, never an absolute one: an absolute path would carry the
operator's filesystem into a published document and would dangle on every other
machine. Copy the run directory elsewhere before relying on those records; once
they are gone the reference degrades to `records not retained` rather than
pointing at nothing.

Each mark is written by the run that produces the block: the replay entry point
sets `replay.inputs` (`private-recording` for an operator's own export) and
`replay.records`; the agent loop sets its own pair plus the report-level
`run_status`, derived from the cells it planned against the cells it actually
measured. `WriteJSON` re-checks every records reference against the directory it
is writing into, so a reference cannot be published pointing at a file that is
already gone.

### Before publishing a replay or agent-loop number

1. Recompute the achievable ceiling **for each fleet shape**; never carry a
   previous fleet's ceiling forward.
2. Quote the fleet shape beside every percentage.
3. Confirm the run is not `partial`, and that no private-recording figure is
   standing alone — `PublicationCheck()` answers both, and returns the caveats
   that must travel with the number even when it publishes.
4. Confirm no report is tracked:
   ```bash
   test -z "$(git ls-files bench/results)" && echo "clean (SC-011)"
   ```
   Use `git ls-files`, **not** `git status --porcelain` — porcelain does not
   list ignored files and would stay silent about an already-tracked report.
   `.github/workflows/bench-results-untracked.yml` runs this same assertion on
   every pull request.

## What is scoped but not yet built (follow-ups)

These require decisions and/or other roles, so they are tracked as child issues
rather than landed here:

- **End-to-end task success with a pinned LLM** — requires a pinned model + an
  LLM-call budget; this is the only part that costs spend. Until then, the
  session-cost estimator above is the honest substitute — and it is labeled
  `estimated`, never `measured`.
- **CI publish-on-release-tag → public static dashboard** — Release/DevOps lane.

## Dataset sources & provenance

Full details and regeneration procedures:
`specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/README.md` (immutability rule: a
refresh is `*_v3.*`, never an edit of a committed `*_v2.*` file).

- **Spec 065 datasets** (`specs/065-evaluation-foundation/datasets/`): the
  45-tool `corpus_v1` snapshot (name+description) and
  `retrieval_golden_v1.json`, generated from 7 permissively reachable no-auth
  reference servers (filesystem, git, memory, sqlite, fetch, time,
  sequential-thinking).
- **`corpus_v2.tools.json`** (committed): the same 45 tools exported **with
  full JSON input schemas** — the universe for all encoding-arm comparisons.
  Captured 2026-07-14 (`corpus_v2@2026-07-14`), canonicalized (sorted tool IDs,
  sorted object keys). Provenance note: the export reads the **Bleve index**
  (`scripts/gen-corpus-v2.sh`), *not* `GET /api/v1/tools` — that REST endpoint
  currently serves stub schemas (supervisor StateView never parses
  `ParamsJSON`); the index is the authoritative record of what the retrieval
  funnel ingests, which is exactly what the arm comparison must measure.
- **`result_fixtures_v1.json`** (committed): 6 deterministic tool-call outputs
  captured once through the proxy from 5 reference servers for the
  `toon_results` arm — 2 tabular, 4 non-tabular; wall-clock values and
  capture-host specifics stripped. License-clean: outputs of our own reference
  servers over our own seed data (`fetch_fixture.html` is the committed fetch
  input).
- **LiveMCPTool snapshot**
  (`specs/083-discovery-profiler/datasets/livemcptool_snapshot/`, committed):
  frozen, normalized copy of the LiveMCPBench tool corpus — **70 servers / 527
  tools**, pinned Hugging Face revision `ddea2d24`
  ([ICIP/LiveMCPBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ICIP/LiveMCPBench),
  arXiv:2508.01780). **Apache-2.0**, redistributed with the mandatory
  attribution in the snapshot's `ATTRIBUTION.md`. Used for token/scale
  measurement only: its task annotations name tools as unqualified free text
  (5/150 names resolve to no corpus tool, 13/150 to multiple servers), so
  relevance labels are *not derivable* — the loader records that absence
  explicitly rather than guessing (FR-011).
- **ToolRet** (never committed): the upstream `mangopy/ToolRet-Tools` +
  `ToolRet-Queries` datasets carry **no stated license**, so redistribution is
  not clearly permitted — the harness **fetches at runtime only**
  (`scripts/fetch-toolret.sh`, pinned revision, `uv run` parquet→JSON) into the
  gitignored `bench/results/cache/` and never writes ToolRet bytes into git
  (FR-013). Retrieval scoring runs on a **seeded query subset**
  (`-subset`/`-seed`): same revision + seed + size ⇒ byte-identical subset on
  every machine. Attribution: ToolRet tool-retrieval benchmark (Hugging Face;
  ACL 2025).
- **Proxy + management tool definitions**: derived at run time from the live
  server tool builders (`internal/server/mcp_routing.go` →
  `buildCallToolModeTools` / `buildCodeExecModeTools`, exposed via
  `internal/server.ProxyModeToolDefs`). No hand-maintained fixture — the
  benchmark cannot drift from the tools the proxy actually serves.
- **TSCG shim** (`bench/tscg/`): committed `shim.mjs` + `package-lock.json`
  pinning `@tscg/core@1.4.3`; `npm ci --prefix bench/tscg` (Node ≥20)
  reproduces the exact runtime everywhere, including CI.

## Known limitations (read before quoting a number)

- **Tokenizer caveat — absolute numbers are estimates.** All token counts use
  `tiktoken cl100k_base` as a reproducible, model-agnostic, offline estimator.
  It can **underestimate other tokenizers (e.g. Claude's) by up to ~60%**, so
  never quote an absolute token count as a Claude cost — but **relative savings
  between arms and modes are stable** across vocabularies, and those are the
  headline numbers. The v2 dashboard renders this caveat next to every
  absolute number (SC-005).
- **The session estimator is an ESTIMATE, not a measurement.** The multi-turn
  session cost is a model — `proxy_menu + calls × mean_response × (1 +
  retry_rate)` — whose retry rates are literature-derived defaults, not
  observations of a live agent loop. Every estimator row is provenance-labeled
  `estimated` and echoes its inputs; treat it as a decision aid, not a benchmark
  result. A measured agent loop is the pinned-LLM follow-up above.
- **Lower-bound arms.** Arms that rewrite or elide description text (TSCG)
  report savings as a lower bound: what they drop cannot be priced back in.
- **v1 offline run: schemas excluded — direction is not clean.** In the legacy
  name+description-only run, input schemas are dropped from *both* sides, so
  that number is its own well-defined metric, not unambiguously conservative.
  The live run adds full schemas for the exact headline number; the Spec 083
  arms measure schema-bearing renderings on `corpus_v2`. Quote those, not the
  v1 offline estimate.
- **Savings scale with tool count.** The 45-tool reference corpus is small; the
  527-tool LiveMCPTool snapshot and the ToolRet subset exist precisely to test
  scale. Quote the corpus size alongside any percentage.
- **LiveMCPTool has no relevance labels** (see provenance above): it validates
  token/scale claims only, never retrieval quality.
- **LAP divergence is expected.** LAP frames the tool menu its own way; within
  ±15% of the in-house count is normal, beyond it is a non-blocking warning —
  never a hidden discrepancy, never a build failure.

## Reproducible live run

`docker-compose.yml` boots mcpproxy over the frozen reference-server config so
the corpus and live tool list are reproducible across machines. The live
accuracy/latency/full-schema/response-cost scorers attach to it via `-live`
(see "Live run" above). Pin the upstream-server images before publishing
headline numbers (image drift can change the tool corpus).

## Reviewer contact

Methodology questions / disputes: open an issue in `smart-mcp-proxy/mcpproxy-go`
and tag the maintainers, or comment on the roadmap benchmark ticket (MCP-42).

Warm it with the one-line command rather than by hand — the same step CI runs
before its parallel test sweep:

```bash
export TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/tiktoken"
go run ./bench/cmd/warmtiktoken
```

Why a dedicated step: `go test ./...` runs packages in parallel, and several
test binaries race to download the same vocabulary into one cache dir. On
Windows the loser fails its whole package on the atomic rename — it surfaced as
`bench/arms` flaking with no code change near it. Naming the cache does not fix
that; populating it first does.
