// replay.go — Spec 103 US1: deterministic cost recomputation over a REAL
// recorded workload (specs/103-token-bench/contracts/replay-input.md).
//
// What replay is. An operator exports their own activity log
// (`mcpproxy activity export --format json`) and supplies a fleet. Replay then
// prices, per mode cell, the tool menu that fleet would put in the agent's
// context, and reports the recorded call shape it was priced against. It costs
// nothing to run, spends no model tokens, and replaces frozen-corpus numbers
// with numbers from a fleet somebody actually uses.
//
// # A fleet input is MANDATORY
//
// A menu is a property of the TOOL DEFINITIONS the agent was shown, and the
// activity export carries no fleet snapshot — not even implicitly, because
// under the direct routing mode the menu is the whole upstream fleet rather
// than a fixed built-in list. So a recording on its own can compute nothing at
// all. That is why `-replay <jsonl>` without a fleet is ErrReplayFleetRequired
// and not a degraded run: there is no reduced figure to degrade TO, and a run
// that quietly produced menu-less output would be a report with no menu cost
// in it, which is the only thing US1 exists to produce.
//
// # What bodies-off can and cannot yield
//
// The default posture reads no request or response bodies (privacy: the
// activity EXPORT path does not mask, so an export is raw user traffic). That
// posture fixes what is knowable, per the contract's table:
//
//   - MENU COST is measured for every cell, from the fleet input.
//   - ABSOLUTE COMPLETE-WORKLOAD COST is available for NO cell, because a
//     complete workload includes every consumed response and that text is
//     absent. It is reported as withheld WITH a reason — never as a zero,
//     which would read as "measured, and it cost nothing".
//   - The CROSS-MODE DELTA between direct_full and direct_deferred IS
//     measurable, because those two cells serve identical call responses and
//     the response term cancels out of the difference. That delta is the
//     honest bodies-off headline. The retrieve cells get no such delta: their
//     serialization axis changes the RESPONSE body, which is exactly the text
//     bodies-off does not have.
//
// Byte lengths do NOT rescue this. `request_bytes` / `response_bytes` are
// pre-truncation BYTE measurements, and the loader deliberately reports them
// as Cost{Basis: CostEstimated, Bytes: n} with NO token count: converting
// bytes to tokens would require a fudge factor nobody sanctioned. So a
// response figure is emitted only when every contributing response was
// genuinely tokenized (bodies-on), and otherwise not at all.
//
// # Every figure is a counterfactual
//
// FR-004 is the spec's most load-bearing constraint and the easiest to lose in
// a headline: a replay recomputes a RECORDED call shape against the SUPPLIED
// fleet. No agent ran under these modes; no model was asked. And because the
// fleet comes from the fleet input rather than the recording, the figures score
// recorded work against TODAY's fleet, not the fleet as it stood when the
// session was recorded — internally valid across modes, not a historical
// reconstruction. ValidateCounterfactual refuses to let a block carrying
// figures leave without saying so.
//
// # Determinism
//
// Two runs over the same inputs must be byte-identical (SC-002), so replay
// reports pin GeneratedAt to ReplayGeneratedAt rather than stamping the wall
// clock. Nothing else here reads a clock, sorts a map, or depends on iteration
// order; the loader already orders sessions deterministically.

// retrieve_tools handler. It does not touch the built-in tool LISTING those
// cells put in the agent's context, which is served in full either way. So
// pricing retrieve_compact's menu with the compact arm would invent a saving
// the wire does not deliver.
//
// The consequence is deliberate and is itself a finding: bodies-off,
// retrieve_full and retrieve_compact have IDENTICAL menu cost, because the
