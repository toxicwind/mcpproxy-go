// Spec 103 US4 — payload decomposition.
//
// Spec 102 projected ~70% savings from deferring input schemas and measured
// 29.7% on the frozen 45-tool corpus, concluding that names, descriptions and
// annotations carry most of the payload rather than schemas. That conclusion
// was drawn from two frozen corpora and never checked against another shape,
// and it is the single claim every reader of the benchmark will want tested.
//
// This file tests it the only way that can be honest: attribute the payload of
// a real corpus to its components and recompute the achievable ceiling FOR THAT
// CORPUS.
//
// Two measurement hazards shape the implementation, and both would produce a
// plausible-looking wrong answer:
//
//  1. TOKENS ARE NOT ADDITIVE ACROSS CONCATENATION. BPE merges across component
//     boundaries, so Count(name) + Count(description) + Count(schema) does not
//     equal Count(name + "\n" + description + "\n" + schema). Counting each
//     component separately yields shares that never sum to the payload and that
//     misattribute every boundary. So the payload is tokenized ONCE and each
//     token is attributed to a component by byte offset, reusing the span
//     partition AttributeTokens already implements for response cost.
//
//  2. THE CORPUS CARRIES NO ANNOTATIONS. bench.Tool is {ToolID, Server, Name,
//     Description, Schema}. Spec 102 measured the production WIRE payload,
//     which includes mcp-go's annotation defaults; the frozen corpora do not.
//     These are different payloads, and a decomposition that silently reported
//     a three-way split as though it settled a claim about four components
//     would read as a confirmation while measuring something else. The
//     Limitation field says so, in the report, next to the verdict.

// PayloadComponent labels the parts of a rendered tool definition.

//  1. A CORPUS WITH NO SCHEMAS yields a 0% schema share, and a verdict phrased

//     corpus that does not contain the thing under test. The committed
//     527-tool snapshot is exactly this case: all 527 tools, zero schemas.
//
//  2. IT IS A DIFFERENT PAYLOAD FROM THE ONE SPEC 102 MEASURED. Spec 102
//     measured the production wire payload — mcp.Tool marshalling, the
//     "[server] " prefix, mcp-go's annotation defaults, the raw-schema
//     placeholder. This decomposition covers the corpus rendering, which has no
//     annotations and no wire framing. A confident CONFIRMED/CORRECTED across
//     that gap would be adjudicating a claim on evidence about something else.
//
