Usage: ${0##*/} [--show-report]

Runs the Playwright Web UI sweep against a throwaway local mcpproxy instance.

Options:
  --show-report    Launch the Playwright HTML report server after the run
  -h, --help       Print this message

Environment:
  MCPPROXY_BINARY_PATH   mcpproxy binary to serve the UI (default: ./mcpproxy, built if absent)
  MCPPROXY_FIXTURE_PATH  optional cmd/mcpfixture binary; registered as a stdio
                         upstream so the sweep sees real servers and tools
  MCPPROXY_BASE_URL      base URL to serve on (default: http://127.0.0.1:18080)
  ARTIFACT_DIR           where the HTML report + server log land
                         (default: <repo>/tmp/web-smoke-artifacts)
